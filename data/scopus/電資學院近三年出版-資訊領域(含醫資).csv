Offensive players must make effective decisions to score a basket in various defensive situations. Virtual reality (VR) has been widely used in the training of athletes to strengthen their ability to make optimal decisions by creating controllable repeatable training scenarios. In this article, an action-aware offensive decision-making training system for basketball using VR and artificial intelligence is proposed. The proposed system is composed of different virtual defensive scenarios and an offensive action recognition framework. Trainees wearing head-mounted display and a motion capture suit are trained by intuitively interacting with the VR system and receive decision suggestions when a bad one is made. This study changes the training media and methods to create an immersive training environment during the training phase and evaluates the training effectiveness. These training scenarios are a conventional tactics board, the proposed VR system with a prerecorded $360^\circ$ panorama video, and the VR system with computer-simulated virtual content. Results indicate that the training scenario affects the training in terms of decision time. ? 2008-2011 IEEE.",Decision-making; sports; training; virtual reality(VR),E-learning; Helmet mounted displays; Interactive computer systems; Real time systems; Sports; Three dimensional computer graphics; Virtual reality; Decisions makings; Feasibility studies; Optimal decisions; Real - Time system; Resist; Three-dimensional display; Training scenario; Training Systems; Virtual reality system; Decision making,"Tsai, W.-L.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: lookoutking@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123676792

However, its clinical effectiveness is inconclusive, and relevant gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs) have been reported. The aim of this meta-analysis was to summarize the existing evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of effects of curcumin on overall cognitive function, individual cognitive domains, and gastrointestinal AE. The study includes 8 RCTs and 389 participants. A random-effects model was used for the meta-analysis. Compared with the placebo group, the curcumin group was associated with an improvement in working memory (Hedges’ g = 0.396, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.078 to 0.714, p = 0.015) and a borderline benefit in processing speed (Hedges’ g = 0.303, 95% CI = ?0.013 to 0.619, p = 0.06). In the domains of language, episodic memory/visual learning, verbal memory, cognitive flexibility/problem solving, and overall cognitive function, no significant difference ex-isted for the comparison between the curcumin and placebo groups. The curcumin group had a significantly higher risk of gastrointestinal AEs than the placebo group (odds ratio = 3.019, 95% CI = 1.118 to 8.150, p = 0.029). In the future, the effects of curcumin on working memory, processing speed, and gastrointestinal AE should be further investigated. ? 2021 by the authors.

A high-resolution (HR) image reconstruction module is indispensable for video analytics chips or devices at the edge. This paper proposes a low-cost and learning-based interpolation method for HR image reconstruction. The proposed method generates reconstructed pixels by processing reference pixels with optimal weights, which are pre-trained by solving the minimum mean square error problem for real images. To reduce the number of computation units and the usage of learned weights, a cross-directional interpolation architecture, which includes a vertical kernel and a horizontal kernel, is adopted. Moreover, a one-dimensional feature discriminator is proposed to improve the quality of up-scaled images efficiently. The main benefit of the proposed method is that it requires a small number of computation units but can still produce high-quality images. The hardware architecture of the proposed method was implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) by using Xilinx UltraScale+ ZCU102 and an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) by using TSMC's 0.13- mu text{m} technology. On the ASIC, the proposed hardware required only approximately 60K gate counts and 50 KBytes of memory. The experimental results indicate that the average peak signal-to-noise ratio of the up-scaled images reached 35.92 dB for the Set-5 dataset. The throughput of the proposed hardware was at least 1000 Mpixels/s on the FPGA and 1200 Mpixels/s on the ASIC, which indicates that the proposed hardware can handle a target resolution higher than 4K in real time. ? 2011 IEEE.",hardware; Image up-scaling; interpolation; machine learning; minimum mean-square-error,Costs; Edge detection; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Image enhancement; Image quality; Image reconstruction; Integrated circuit design; Interpolation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Logic gates; Pixels; Signal to noise ratio; Application-specific integrated circuits; Hardware; High resolution image reconstruction; Image edge detection; Image up-scaling; Images reconstruction; Kernel; Low cost hardware; Upscaling; Mean square error,"Chen, P.-Y.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: pychen@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118235391

We hypothesized that certain genetic abnormalities were associated with lymphomatous effusions, which would help to identify related pathways, oncogenic mechanisms, and therapeutic targets. Methods: We compared whole-exome sequencing on DLBCL samples involving solid organs (n = 22) and involving effusions (n = 9). We designed a mutational accumulation-based approach to score each gene and used mutation interpreters to identify candidate pathogenic genes associated with lymphomatous effusions. Moreover, we performed gene-set enrichment analysis from a microarray comparison of effusion-associated versus non-effusion-associated DLBCL cases to extract the related pathways. Results: We found that genes involved in identified pathways or with high accumulation scores in the effusion-based DLBCL cases were associated with migration/invasion. We validated expression of 8 selected genes in DLBCL cell lines and clinical samples: MUC4, SLC35G6, TP53BP2, ARAP3, IL13RA1, PDIA4, HDAC1 and MDM2, and validated expression of 3 proteins (MUC4, HDAC1 and MDM2) in an independent cohort of DLBCL cases with (n = 31) and without (n = 20) lymphomatous effusions. We found that overexpression of HDAC1 and MDM2 correlated with the presence of lymphomatous effusions, and HDAC1 overexpression was associated with the poorest prognosis. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that DLBCL associated with lymphomatous effusions may be associated mechanistically with TP53-MDM2 pathway and HDAC-related chromatin remodeling mechanisms. ? 2021, The Author(s).",Bioinformatics; Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; HDAC1; Lymphomatous effusions; Prognosis; Sequencing; Whole exome,B lymphocyte receptor; beta actin; breakpoint cluster region protein; cytokine; DNA polymerase; focal adhesion kinase; genomic DNA; glycoprotein; histone deacetylase 1; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; Ki 67 antigen; mannomustine; membrane protein; monoclonal antibody; mouse double minute 2 homolog; mucin 4; mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1; Notch1 receptor; protein; protein bcl 2; protein p53; SUMO protein; synaptophysin; toll like receptor; transcription factor EZH2; vasculotropin; adult; aged; ArfGAP with RhoGAP domain ankyrin repeat And PH domain 3; Article; B cell lymphoma cell; B lymphocyte; bioinformatics; cancer prognosis; cell culture; cell cycle; cell migration; chromatin assembly and disassembly; cohort analysis; controlled study; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; DNA extraction; down regulation; Escherichia coli; female; gene; gene expression; gene library; gene set enrichment analysis; human; illumina sequencing; immunohistochemistry; interleukin 13 receptor subunit alpha 1; JAK-STAT signaling; major clinical study; male; MAPK signaling; microarray analysis; middle aged; mutation; oncogene c myc; organ; pathogenicity; pathology; polymerase chain reaction; primary effusion lymphoma; protein disulfide isomerase family A member 4; quality control; RNA extraction; sequence analysis; signal transduction; solute carrier family 35 member G6; somatic hypermutation; tissues; tumor gene; tumor invasion; tumor protein P53 binding protein 2; validation process; very elderly; Western blotting; whole exome sequencing,"Chiang, J.-H.; Intelligent Information Retrieval Lab, Taiwan; 電子郵件: jchiang@mail.ncku.edu.tw

Retrospectively, immunohistochemistry along with H-score recording was carried out to evaluate the GNB4 protein levels on tissues from UC patients. Correlations between GNB4 H-score and imperative clinicopathological factors, as well as the implication of GNB4 protein level on disease-specific and metastasis-free survivals were assessed. In UTUCs (n = 340) and UBUCs (n = 295), 170 (50.0%) and 148 (50.0%) cases, respectively, were identified to be of high GNB4 expression. The GNB4 protein levels were correlated to numerous clinicopathological features and patients’ survivals. Upregulation of the GNB4 protein was significantly associated with primary tumor, nodal metastasis, histological grade, vascular invasion and mitotic rate. High GNB4 protein levels independently and significantly predicted poor disease-specific and metastasis-free in UTUC and UBUC, respectively. Ingenuity pathway analysis furthermore showed that multiple signaling pathways were enriched including ‘Communication between Innate and Adaptive Immune Cells’ and ‘NFκB Signaling’. Our findings demonstrated that the upregulation of the GNB4 protein is an independent unfavorable prognosticator in UC. High GNB4 gene expression plays an important role in UC progression. ? 2021, The Japanese Society for Clinical Molecular Morphology.",G protein subunit beta 4; GNB4; Molecular pathology; Prognostic marker; Urothelial carcinoma,"aspartate aminotransferase; cisplatin; g protein subunit beta 4; guanine nucleotide binding protein; long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; protein p53; transcriptome; unclassified drug; adult; aged; Article; cancer grading; cancer mortality; cancer prognosis; cancer specific survival; cancer staging; cancer survival; cell proliferation; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; cystectomy; cystoscopy; data mining; disease free survival; disease specific survival; female; follow up; gene expression; gene ontology; Gleason score; histopathology; human; human tissue; immunocompetent cell; immunohistochemistry; major clinical study; male; median survival time; metastasis free survival; microarray analysis; mitosis index; mitosis rate; molecular pathology; nephroureterectomy; NF kB signaling; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; overall survival; perineural invasion; prognosis; prostate cancer; protein expression; radical nephrectomy; survival analysis; survival rate; tissue microarray; transcription initiation; transcriptomics; transitional cell carcinoma; tumor invasion; tumor volume; upregulation; urine cytology; bladder tumor; protein subunit; retrospective study; transitional cell carcinoma; Carcinoma, Transitional Cell; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Protein Subunits; Retrospective Studies; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms","Li, C.-F.; Department of Medical Research, 901 Zhanghua Rd, Taiwan; 電子郵件: angelo.p@yahoo.com.tw

Although consensus NLS/NES sequence motifs have been defined for cargoes of some NTRs, many experimentally identified cargoes of those NTRs lack those motifs, and consensus NLSs/NESs have been reported for only a few NTRs. Crystal structures of NTR–cargo complexes have exemplified 3D structure-dependent binding of cargoes lacking a consensus NLS/NES to different sites on an NTR. Since only a limited number of NTR–cargo interactions have been studied, whether most cargoes lacking a consensus NLS/NES bind to the same confined interface or to various sites on an NTR is still unclear. Addressing this issue, we generated four mutants of transportin-(Trn)SR, of which many cargoes lack a consensus NLS, and eight mutants of Imp13, where no consensus NLS has been defined, and we analyzed their binding to as many as 40 cargo candidates that we previously identified by a nuclear import reaction-based method. The cargoes bind differently to the NTR mutants, suggesting that positions on an NTR contribute differently to the binding of respective cargoes. ? 2021, The Author(s).",,"karyopherin beta; transportin SR; cell nucleus; metabolism; mutation; nuclear localization signal; nucleocytoplasmic transport; Active Transport, Cell Nucleus; beta Karyopherins; Cell Nucleus; Mutation; Nuclear Localization Signals","Kimura, M.; Cellular Dynamics Laboratory, Japan; 電子郵件: makimura@riken.jp

They drew contour of the picture under patch of a better eye for 6?months. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), grating acuity (GA), and contrast sensitivity (CS) were assessed at the baseline, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th months of training. All participants completed the 6-month training. Patched eyes of both groups exhibited no difference. Trained eyes of the control group had significantly slight improvement in BCVA and GA.

However, in most scenarios, the tracking operations of these monitoring systems are performed manually. These operations should be automated. This paper proposes using a conditional random field (CRF) to formulate the automatic execution problem as a cost minimization problem. The appearance of pedestrians and the time taken by them to cross the view of a camera are used to solve the automatic execution problem. Crowd psychology is used to define constraints and construct a CRF graph. A Siamese convolutional neural network is employed to recognize pedestrian appearance. The time spent by pedestrians crossing the view of a camera is modeled using a normal distribution. The results of two models are considered as the costs of nodes and edges. The proposed algorithm is applied under constraints to determine matches at the minimum cost. The accuracy of the proposed method is compared with that of other methods by using common datasets and benchmarks. Superior results are obtained when both appearance and spatiotemporal information are employed for solving the automatic execution problem than when using appearance alone. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Across-camera object tracking; Conditional random field; Siamese convolutional neural network,Cameras; Convolutional neural networks; Monitoring; Normal distribution; Random processes; Conditional random field; Cost minimization; Minimum cost; Monitoring system; Public space; Spatiotemporal information; Time spent; Tracking operations; Object tracking,"Horng, G.-J.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: grojium@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105846230

We constructed a cancer evolutionary tree using bulk-targeted deep sequencing to explore the impact of sequential and co-occurring somatic mutations on patients with stage III colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods: A total of 108 stage III CRC patients from National Cheng Kung University Hospital (NCKUH) were recruited for this study between Jan. 2014 and Jan. 2019. Clinical information and tumor-targeted deep sequencing data were collected. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed for evolutionary trajectories. We used a machine learning model for survival analysis. Results: Six sequential somatic mutations stratified patients into seven subgroups based on survival. Patients carrying sequential germline followed by DNA damage response-related ATM or BRCA2 somatic mutations or non-TP53, APC somatic mutations had a better outcome than those without such mutations. The 4-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) probability was 88% in the low-risk group (G1) and 46% in the high-risk group (G2) (log-rank p-value 2e-05). The predictive efficacy by the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.73, 0.7, 0.797, and 0.88 at 2, 4, 6, and 8 years, respectively. The mutation status of mismatch repair (MMR) genes was not associated with RFS. Different genomic features were found between the groups. The orders of APC, KRAS and APC, BRCA2 sequential somatic mutations were associated with clinical outcomes. The occurrence of somatic mutations in BRCA2, such as TP53 somatic mutations, affected recurrence-free survival. Conclusions: According to the evolution model, DNA damage response (DDR)-related ATM or BRCA2 somatic mutations are promising biomarkers for assessing the response of stage III CRC patients to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. The sequential order and co-occurring DDR somatic mutations are associated with recurrence-free survival. ? 2021, The Author(s).",Colorectal cancer; DNA damage response gene; Sequential somatic mutations; Tumor evolution; Tumor heterogeneity,"APC protein; ATM protein; BRCA2 protein; DNA; fluorouracil; folinic acid; oxaliplatin; protein p53; APC protein; APC protein, human; BRCA2 protein; BRCA2 protein, human; KRAS protein, human; oxaliplatin; protein p21; adjuvant therapy; adult; aged; Article; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer evolutionary tree; cancer patient; cancer staging; cancer survival; clinical outcome; colorectal cancer; controlled study; DNA damage response; female; gene mutation; genetic association; germline mutation; high risk population; human; human tissue; low risk population; machine learning; major clinical study; male; mismatch repair; mutational analysis; oncogene K ras; oncological parameters; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; recurrence free survival; somatic mutation; Taiwan; treatment response; university hospital; cancer staging; colorectal tumor; DNA damage; genetics; middle aged; mortality; mutation; pathology; Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein; Aged; BRCA2 Protein; Colorectal Neoplasms; DNA Damage; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Neoplasm Staging; Oxaliplatin; Phylogeny; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)","Shen, M.-R.; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, Taiwan; 電子郵件: mrshen@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101898256

We used deletion structural variants (DSVs) generated from germline whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and DSV immune-related association tumor microenvironment (TME) to predict cancer risk and prognosis. Methods: We investigated the contribution of germline DSVs to cancer susceptibility and prognosis by silicon and causal inference models. DSVs in germline WGS data were generated from the blood samples of 192 cancer and 499 non-cancer subjects. Clinical information, including family cancer history (FCH), was obtained from the National Cheng Kung University Hospital and Taiwan Biobank. Ninety-nine colorectal cancer (CRC) patients had immune response gene expression data. We used joint calling tools and an attention-weighted model to build the cancer risk predictive model and identify DSVs in familial cancer. The survival support vector machine (survival-SVM) was used to select prognostic DSVs. Results: We identified 671 DSVs that could predict cancer risk. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of the attention-weighted model was 0.71. The 3 most frequent DSV genes observed in cancer patients were identified as ADCY9, AURKAPS1, and RAB3GAP2 (p < 0.05). The DSVs in SGSM2 and LHFPL3 were relevant to colorectal cancer. We found a higher incidence of FCH in cancer patients than in non-cancer subjects (p < 0.05). SMYD3 and NKD2DSV genes were associated with cancer patients with FCH (p < 0.05). We identified 65 immune-associated DSV markers for assessing cancer prognosis (p < 0.05). The functional protein of MUC4 DSV gene interacted with MAGE1 expression, according to the STRING database. The causal inference model showed that deleting the CEP72 DSV gene affect the recurrence-free survival (RFS) of IFIT1 expression. Conclusions: We established an explainable attention-weighted model for cancer risk prediction and used the survival-SVM for prognostic stratification by using germline DSVs and immune gene expression datasets. Comprehensive assessments of germline DSVs can predict the cancer risk and clinical outcome of colon cancer patients. ? 2021, The Author(s).",Cancer risk; CEP72; Deletion structural variants; MUC4; Whole-genome sequencing,"K ras protein; manganese superoxide dismutase; mucin 4; mucin 6; protein p53; regulatory associated protein of mTOR; SHC transforming protein 3; silicon; CEP72 protein, human; microtubule associated protein; MUC4 protein, human; mucin 4; ADAP1 gene; ADCY8 gene; ADCY9 gene; adult; aged; Article; AURKAPS1 gene; B3GNTL1 gene; breast cancer; CACN gene; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer risk; cancer susceptibility; CBX3 gene; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; colorectal carcinoma; controlled study; CTP4FI2 gene; CYP4FI1 gene; ERC1 gene; female; female genital tract cancer; GALNT9 gene; gene deletion; gene expression; GNG2 gene; hereditary tumor syndrome; human; human cell; IFIT1 gene; immune response gene; KCNMB2 gene; LHFPL3 gene; MAGE1 gene; MAGEA1 gene; major clinical study; male; MYT1 gene; ovary carcinoma; PPP6R2 gene; PSMA8 gene; RAB3GAP2 gene; recurrence free survival; recurrent disease; SBF2 gene; SDSM2 gene; SMYD3 gene; support vector machine; Taiwan; tumor microenvironment; UNCD13B gene; whole genome sequencing; colorectal tumor; gene deletion; gene expression regulation; genetic predisposition; genetics; germline mutation; immunity; immunology; middle aged; pathology; Adult; Aged; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Germ-Line Mutation; Humans; Immunity; Male; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Middle Aged; Mucin-4; Sequence Deletion; Tumor Microenvironment","Chiang, J.-H.; Institute of Medical Informatics, Taiwan; 電子郵件: jchiang@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099217638

This is because the lithium prediction strategies available developed by previous studies are still limited due to insufficient prediction performance. Thus, we used machine learning approaches to predict lithium concentration in a large real-world dataset. Real-world data from multicenter electronic medical ecords were used in different machine learning algorithms to predict: (1) whether the serum level was 0.6–1.2 mmol/L or 0.0–0.6 mmol/L (binary prediction), and (2) its concentration value (continuous prediction). We developed models from 1505 samples through 5-fold cross-validation and used 204 independent samples to test their performance by evaluating their accuracy. Moreover, we ranked the most important clinical features in different models and reconstructed three reduced models with fewer clinical features. For binary and continuous predictions, the average accuracy of these models was 0.70–0.73 and 0.68–0.75, respectively. Seven features were listed as important features related to serum lithium levels of 0.6–1.2 mmol/L or higher lithium concentration, namely older age, lower systolic blood pressure, higher daily and last doses of lithium prescription, concomitant psychotropic drugs with valproic acid and -pine drugs, and comorbid substance-related disorders. After reducing the features in the three new predictive models, the binary or continuous models still had an average accuracy of 0.67–0.74. Machine learning processes complex clinical data and provides a potential tool for predicting lithium concentration. This may help in clinical decision-making and reduce the frequency of serum level monitoring. ? 2021 by the authors.",Bipolar disorder; Lithium; Machine learning; Random forest; Support vector machine; Therapeutic drug monitoring; XGBoost,,"Hsu, C.-W.; Department of Psychiatry, Taiwan; 電子郵件: harwicacademia@gmail.com

Nevertheless, the large demands for the computation and memory resources make these methods difficult to be deployed in the field as the resource-constrained IoT devices would be overwhelmed by the computations incurred by the inference operations of the deployed deep learning models. In this article, we propose the adaptive computation framework, which is built on top of the distributed deep neural networks (DDNNs), to facilitate the inference computations of a trained DDNN model to be collaboratively executed by the machines in a distributed computing hierarchy, e.g., the end device and the cloud server. By facilitating the trained models to be run on the actual distributed systems, the proposed framework enables the co-design of the distributed deep learning models and systems, since the delivered performance of the models on the systems, in terms of the inference time, consumed energy and model accuracy, is able to be measured and is served as the input for the next cycle for the model/system design. We have built the surveillance system for the object detection application with the prototyped framework. We use the surveillance system as a case study to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed framework. In addition, the design considerations of developing the DDNN system are shared. With the promising results presented in the article, we believe that the framework paves a road for the automated design process of the distributed deep learning models/systems. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Distributed deep learning models design; Distributed systems design; Embedded devices; Internet-of-Things applications; MQTT; OpenCL accelerations; Parallel computing,Computational mechanics; Deep neural networks; Design; Distributed computer systems; Distributed database systems; Internet of things; Learning systems; Network security; Object detection; Security systems; Adaptive computations; Automated design; Design considerations; Distributed systems; Internet of thing (IOT); Learning methods; Memory resources; Surveillance systems; Deep learning,"Sun, Q.H.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: afuluodite18@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105002216

These devices perform the computations intermittently, where the code executions are halted and resumed depending on the availability of the harvested energy. On such devices, the capacitors are present and served as the energy buffers for preserving the program states when sudden power outages occur. Nevertheless, the capacitors have relatively shorter lifetimes, compared with the rest of hardware components on the devices, and larger capacitors, which are desired by the systems requiring complex computations, hamper the achievement of device miniaturization, e.g., for medical implants or smart dust. In this article, we propose a new intermittent checkpointing strategy, iCheck, to tackle the issues raised for the program-state retaining when the capacitors are not functioning correctly (or when the capacitor-less devices are adopted). The proposed iCheck is designed to perform the checkpointing-based program-state preserving progressively with being aware of the power-failure characteristics of the harvested energy source to maximize the progress forwarding and to ensure data consistency while encountering incomplete checkpoints caused by sudden power losses. The proposed design is evaluated with a series of experiments with encouraging results. ? 1982-2012 IEEE.",Capacitor-less systems; energy harvesting systems; intermittent systems; progressive checkpointing,Energy conservation; Energy harvesting; Capacitor-less; Complex computation; Data consistency; Energy harvesting device; Hardware components; Health monitoring; Intermittent systems; Medical implants; Outages,"Tu, C.-H.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: chiaheng@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098781207

We apply Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) techniques for literature mining in the cancer gene panel. A literature-derived 4,679 × 4,630 gene term-feature matrix was built. The EGFR L858R and T790M, and BRAF V600E genetic variants are important mutation term features in text mining and are frequently mutated in cancer. We validate the cancer gene panel by the mutational landscape of different cancer types. The cosine similarity of gene frequency between text mining and a statistical result from clinical sequencing data is 80.8%. In different machine learning models, the best accuracy for the prediction of two different gene panels, including MSK-IMPACT (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets), and Oncomine cancer gene panel, is 0.959, and 0.989, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis confirmed that the neural net model has a better prediction performance (Area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.992). The use of text-mined co-occurrence features can contextualize each gene.

However, the nature of brachytherapy, organ deformities, metal induced artifacts caused by applicators, and limited operating time make this process a challenge. Deep learning segmentation has recently emerged as an approach to this problem. The basic concept proposed in this paper is accurate segmentation of a pelvic computed tomography image dataset such that patients can obtain more accurate radiotherapy. Methods: In this work, we propose a solution based on 3D U-Net and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The model was trained and tested on a computed tomography pelvic image dataset comprising 51 patients who underwent 3D brachytherapy. The organs that required segmentation included the bladder, bowels, sigmoid colon, rectum, and uterus. We also used self-ensemble to improve segmentation accuracy. The Dice coefficient was used as the evaluation metric to determine the segmentation results for all of the organs under consideration. Results: The proposed model was evaluated using organ segmentation obtained from 10 patients with newly diagnosed stage I-IVA cervical cancer. The test results showed that segmentation conducted using the proposed model resulted in the following Dice coefficient values (mean, ± standard deviation): 87 (± 6.3) %, 72 (± 9.1) %, 72 (± 7.8) %, 95 (± 3.5) %, 86 (± 4.9) %, 77 (± 8.4) %, 73 (± 10.2) %, and 93 (± 3.5) % for the HRCTV, GTV, bowels, foley, bladder, rectum, sigmoid colon, and uterus, respectively.

Typically, the monitoring is to perceive surrounding environments with battery-powered, tiny devices deployed in the field. While deep learning-based methods, especially the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are promising approaches to enriching the functionalities offered by the tiny devices, they demand more computation and memory resources, which makes these methods difficult to be adopted on such devices. In this article, we develop a software framework, RAP, that permits the construction of the CNN designs by aggregating the existing, lightweight CNN layers, which are able to fit in the limited memory (e.g., several KBs of SRAM) on the resource-constrained devices satisfying application-specific timing constrains. RAP leverages the Python-based neural network framework Chainer to build the CNNs by mounting the C/C++ implementations of the lightweight layers, trains the built CNN models as the ordinary model-training procedure in Chainer, and generates the C version codes of the trained models. The generated programs are compiled into target machine executables for the on-device inferences. With the vigorous development of lightweight CNNs, such as binarized neural networks with binary weights and activations, RAP facilitates the model building process for the resource-constrained devices by allowing them to alter, debug, and evaluate the CNN designs over the C/C++ implementation of the lightweight CNN layers. We have prototyped the RAP framework and built two environmental monitoring applications for protecting endangered species using image- and acoustic-based monitoring methods. Our results show that the built model consumes less than 0.5 KB of SRAM for buffering the runtime data required by the model inference while achieving up to 93% of accuracy for the acoustic monitoring with less than one second of inference time on the TI 16-bit microcontroller platform. ? 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.",convolutional neural network design; Cyber-physical system; end-device inference; environmental monitoring application; monitoring endangered species; neural network software framework; resource-constrained devices,Application programs; Conservation; Convolution; Cyber Physical System; Deep learning; Monitoring; Multilayer neural networks; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional neural network design; End-device inference; End-devices; Endangered species; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental monitoring application; Monitoring applications; Monitoring endangered species; Neural network designs; Neural network software; Neural network software framework; Resourceconstrained devices; Software frameworks; Embedded systems,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116006545

Comfortable sensing and accurate analysis in sleep monitoring is beneficial to many healthcare and medical applications. From 2020, owing to the COVID?19 pandemic that spreads between people when they come into close physical contact with one another, the willingness to go to hospital for receiving care has reduced; care-at-home is the trend in modern healthcare. Therefore, a home-use and real-time sleep-staging system is developed in this paper. Methods: We developed and implemented a real-time sleep staging system that integrates a wearable eye mask for high-quality electroencephalogram/electrooculogram measurement and a mobile device with MobileNETV2 deep learning model for sleep-stage identification. In the experiments, 25 all-night recordings were acquired, 17 of which were used for training, and the remaining eight were used for testing. Results: The averaged scoring agreements for the wake, light sleep, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement stages were 85.20%, 87.17%, 82.87%, and 89.30%, respectively, for our system compared with the manual scoring of PSG recordings. In addition, the mean absolute errors of four objective sleep measurements, including sleep efficiency, total sleep time, sleep onset time, and wake after sleep onset time were 1.68%, 7.56?min, 5.50?min, and 3.94?min, respectively. No significant differences were observed between the proposed system and manual PSG scoring in terms of the percentage of each stage and the objective sleep measurements. Conclusion: These experimental results demonstrate that our system provides high scoring agreements in sleep staging and unbiased sleep measurements owing to the use of EEG and EOG signals and powerful mobile computing based on deep learning networks. These results also suggest that our system is applicable for home-use real-time sleep monitoring. ? 2021, Taiwanese Society of Biomedical Engineering.",Automatic sleep-staging method; EEG; EOG; Eye mask; Home use; Mobile platform; MobileNetV2; Real time,Electroencephalography; Eye movements; Learning systems; Medical applications; mHealth; Sleep research; Wakes; Accurate analysis; Human activities; Learning network; Mean absolute error; Physical contacts; Rapid eye movement; Sleep efficiencies; Sleep monitoring; Deep learning; adult; Article; deep learning; electroencephalogram; electrooculogram; female; human; human experiment; male; REM sleep; scoring system; sleep; sleep efficiency; sleep stage; sleep time; sleep waking cycle; slow wave sleep; stage 1 sleep; stage 2 sleep; young adult,"Liang, S.-F.; Dept. of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: sfliang@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114180020

A protein-protein interaction might play different roles in diverse cancer types. Hence, prioritizing the PPIs in each cancer type would help detect cancer-associated pathways, find a better understanding of cancer biology, and facilitate drug discovery. Several studies to date have proposed computational methods for extracting the PPI essentiality of different cancer types based on the PPI network. The main drawback of these studies is not using a rich source such as genomics variant data. An amino acid sequence encodes useful information about protein structure and behavior. We represent each amino acid sequence based on its variants/mutations in seven different ways: binary vectors, pathogenicity scores, binding affinity changes upon mutations, gene expression-based network of the interactions, biophysicochemical properties, g-gap dipeptide, and one-hot vectors. Based on these representations, we design and consider seven different deep learning models. Then, we compare the accuracy of these models in predicting 20 different cancer types from the TCGA cohort. WinBinVec is a window-based model that outperforms the other models. Moreover, WinBinVec contains a PPI essentiality module that helps extract the essentiality probability of each PPI for every cancer type. ? 2013 IEEE.",cancer type prediction; Cancer-associated PPIs; deep learning; metastasis prediction; mutation accumulation,"Amino acids; Binding energy; Diseases; Gene expression; Learning systems; Proteins; Amino acid sequence; Binding affinities; Cancer biology; Learning models; Protein structures; Protein-protein interaction extractions; Protein-protein interactions; Window-based Model; Deep learning; amino acid sequence; Article; artificial neural network; binding affinity; cancer model; cell proliferation; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; controlled study; deep learning; endometrium cancer; entropy; feature extraction; gene expression; gene frequency; gene mutation; human; learning algorithm; machine learning; major clinical study; metastasis; mutation accumulation; natural language processing; pathogenicity; protein protein interaction; protein structure; proteomics; sequence analysis; support vector machine; training; tumor growth; tumor-related gene; whole exome sequencing; biology; genetics; neoplasm; protein analysis; protein; Amino Acid Sequence; Computational Biology; Deep Learning; Humans; Neoplasms; Neural Networks, Computer; Protein Interaction Mapping; Proteins","Lin, P.-C.; Department of Internal Medicine, Taiwan; 電子郵件: pengchan@mail.ncku.edu.tw

A multicenter retrospective cohort study and a dose-response meta-analysis were conducted. Methods: The cohort study was conducted in Taiwan from 2001 to 2019 to identify patients with euthymic BD according to different serum levels (<0.4, 0.4–0.8, and 0.8–1.2?mmol/L). We adopted adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for time to the recurrence of mood episodes having the <0.4?mmol/L group as the reference group. Moreover, we systematically searched for related articles in major databases before January 31, 2021 (PROSPERO: CRD42021235812). We used random-effects modeling to estimate the dose-response relationships between lithium serum levels and recurrence of mood episodes, which were depicted as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Results: A total of 1406 participants (cohort: 466; meta-analysis: 940) were included. In the cohort study, the 0.4–0.8?mmol/L group was associated with a significantly lower risk of recurrences (aHR: 0.75), while the 0.8–1.2?mmol/L group had a lower risk without statistical significance (aHR: 0.77). The dose-response meta-analysis showed that with the increase in lithium serum levels, the risk decreased (linear model OR: 0.85, for every 0.1?mmol/L increase; non-linear model OR: 1.00 at 0.0?mmol/L, 0.42 at 0.4?mmol/L, and 0.27 at 0.8?mmol/L). Conclusion: Although confounding by indication cannot be excluded, the combined results suggest a significant preventative effect on the recurrence of major affective episodes among those with serum levels of 0.4–0.8?mmol/L. ? 2021 The Authors.

For magnetic resonance imaging, segmentation of the carpal tunnel and its contents, including flexor tendons and the median nerve for magnetic resonance images is an important issue. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which was modified by the original DeepLabv3 + model to segment three primary structures of the carpal tunnel: the carpal tunnel, flexor tendon, and median nerve. Methods: To extract important feature maps for segmentation of the carpal tunnel, flexor tendon, and median nerve, the proposed CNN model termed modified DeepLabv3 + uses DenseNet-121 as a backbone and adds dilated convolution to the original spatial pyramid pooling module. A MaskTrack method was used to refine the segmented results generated by modified DeepLabv3 + , which have a small and blurred appearance. For evaluation of the segmentation results, the average Dice similarity coefficients (ADSC) were used as the performance index. Results: Sixteen MR images corresponding to different subjects were obtained from the National Cheng Kung University Hospital. Our proposed modified DeepLabv3 + generated the following ADSCs: 0.928 for carpal tunnel, 0.872 for flexor tendons and 0.785 for the median nerve. The ADSC value of 0.8053 generated the MaskTrack that 0.22 ADSC measure were improved for measuring the median nerve. Conclusions: The experimental results showed that the proposed modified DeepLabv3 + model can promote segmentations of the carpal tunnel and its contents. The results are superior to the results generated by original DeepLabv3 +. Additionally, MaskTrack can also effectively refine median nerve segmentations. ? 2021, The Author(s).",Carpal tunnel syndrome; Convolutional neural networks; Magnetic resonance; MaskTrack; Modified DeepLabv3 +; Segmentation,Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Magnetism; Resonance; Automatic segmentations; Carpal tunnel syndrome; Important features; National Cheng-Kung University; Performance indices; Peripheral neuropathy; Segmentation results; Similarity coefficients; Tendons; Article; carpal tunnel syndrome; convolutional neural network; flexor tendon; human; median nerve; model; nuclear magnetic resonance,"Horng, M.-H.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: horng@mail.nptu.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107053365

However, the accuracy of RRAM-based NN computing can degrade significantly, due to the intrinsic statistical variations of the resistance of RRAM cells. In this article, we propose SIGHT, a synergistic algorithm-architecture fault-tolerant framework, to holistically address this issue. Specifically, we consider three major types of faults for RRAM computing: 1) nonlinear resistance distribution; 2) static variation; and 3) dynamic variation. From the algorithm level, we propose a resistance-aware quantization to compel the NN parameters to follow the exact nonlinear resistance distribution as RRAM, and introduce an input regulation technique to compensate for RRAM variations. We also propose a selective weight refreshing scheme to address the dynamic variation issue that occurs at runtime. From the architecture level, we propose a general and low-cost architecture accordingly for supporting our fault-tolerant scheme. Our evaluation demonstrates almost no accuracy loss for our three fault-tolerant algorithms, and the proposed SIGHT architecture incurs performance overhead as little as 7.14%. ? 1982-2012 IEEE.",Neural network (NN); reliability; resistive random access memory (RRAM),Fault tolerance; Network architecture; Neural networks; RRAM; Algorithm architectures; Fault tolerant algorithms; Fault tolerant schemes; Neural network parameters; Processing capability; Resistive random access memory (rram); Static and dynamic faults; Statistical variations; Memory architecture,"Lin, J.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, United States; 電子郵件: jilan@ucsb.edu",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096380721

Current various kinds of connectivity do not well reflect the fault tolerance of a network under these attacks. This observation inspires a new measure for network reliability to resist the block attack by taking into account of the dispersity of the remaining nodes. Let GG be a network, C\subset V(G)C?V(G) and G[C]G[C] be a connected subgraph. Then CC is called an hh-faulty-block of GG if G-CG-C is disconnected, and every component of G-CG-C has at least h+1h+1 nodes. The minimum cardinality over all hh-faulty-blocks of GG is called hh-faulty-block connectivity of GG, denoted by {FB}\kappa _h(G)FBκh(G). In this article, we determine {FB}\kappa _h(Q_n)FBκh(Qn) for nn-dimensional hypercube Q_nQn (n\geq 4n?4), a classic interconnection network. We establish that {FB}\kappa _h(Q_n)=(h+2)n-3h-1FBκh(Qn)=(h+2)n-3h-1 for 0\leq h\leq 10?h?1, and {FB}\kappa _h(Q_n)=(h+2)n-4h+1FBκh(Qn)=(h+2)n-4h+1 for 2\leq h\leq n-22?h?n-2, respectively. Larger hh-faulty-block connectivity implies that an attacker will have to stage an attack to a bigger block of connected nodes, so that each remaining components will not be too small, which will in turn limit the size of large components. In other words, there will not be great disparity in sizes between any two remaining components, and hence there will less likely be a significantly large remaining communication group. The larger the hh-faulty-block, the more difficult for an attacker to achieve that goal. As a consequence, the resistance of the network against the attacker will increase. Our experiments also show that as hh increases, the hh-faulty-block gets larger, and the size disparity between any two remaining components decreases. In turn, as expected, the size of the largest remaining communication group becomes smaller. ? 1968-2012 IEEE.",block attack; fault-tolerance; faulty-block connectivity; hypercube; Network reliability,Computer science; Software engineering; Cardinalities; Connected Subgraph; Dispersity; Network reliability; Remaining component; Interconnection networks (circuit switching),,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091683203

Methods This study utilized two nationwide datasets in Taiwan: the Notifiable Disease Dataset of con-firmed cases from the Centers for Disease Control to identify JE patients, and the National Health Insurance Research Database to obtain patients’ healthcare utilization. Survival analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors associated with the all-cause mortality of patients. Results This study included 352 adult cases with JE (aged?20 years). The mean age of JE patients was 45 years. Stroke (event rate: 3.49/100 person-years) was the most common neurological complication, followed by epilepsy/convulsions (3.13/100 person-years), encephalopa-thy/delirium (2.20/100 person-years), and parkinsonism (1.97/100 person-years). Among the 336 hospitalized patients at JE diagnosis, 58.33% required intensive care. Among 79 patients who died following JE diagnosis, 48.84% of death events occurred within the year of diagnosis. The medical costs increased considerably at JE diagnosis and subsequent-year costs remained significantly higher than the costs before diagnosis (p<0.05). Having a four-dose JE vaccination (i.e., born after 1976) versus no JE vaccination history (i.e., born before 1963) was significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality (hazard ratio: 0.221 [95% confidence interval: 0.067, 0.725]). Comorbid diabetes and incident epilepsy/convul-sion events significantly increased the mortality risk by 2.47-and 1.85-fold, respectively (p<0.05). Conclusion A considerable medical burden associated with JE was observed in affected adults, even in the years following JE diagnosis.

Moreover, it increases the allowed faulty vertices, hence enhancing the diagnosability of the network. There have been lots of state-of-the-art literatures concerning the h-extra fault diagnosability. Although there are some methods to theoretically prove the extra fault diagnosability of some other well-known networks under MM? model, these methods have some serious flaws when there exists a 4-cycle in these networks. In this article, we investigate the reason that caused the flawed results in some references, and we derive a different, broadly applicable, and complete fault tolerant method to establish the extra fault diagnosability in an n-dimensional alternating group graph AG_n under MM? model. The complete fault tolerant method adopts combinatorial properties and linearly many fault analysis to conquer the core of our proofs. Moreover, we compare the extra fault diagnosability of AG_n with various types of fault diagnosability, including the diagnosability, strong diagnosability, conditional diagnosability, t/k-diagnosability, and pessimistic diagnosability. It can be seen that the extra fault diagnosability is greater than all the other types of fault diagnosability. ? 1963-2012 IEEE.",Alternating group graph; complete method; extra fault diagnosability; fault diagnosis; MM; model,Reliability; Safety engineering; Alternating group graph; Combinatorial properties; Conditional diagnosability; Diagnostic strategy; Fault diagnosability; Fault-tolerant method; State of the art; Strong diagnosability; Fault tolerance,"Lin, L.; College of Mathematics and Informatics, Fujian, China; 電子郵件: putianlinlimei@163.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114339697

There are numerous challenges in terms of drug resistance, therapeutic strategies, and biomarkers in immunotherapy. In this study, we analyzed primary tumor samples from 533 cancer patients with six different cancer types using deep targeted sequencing and gene expression data from 78 colorectal cancer patients, whereby driver mutations, mutational signatures, tumor-associated neoantigens, and molecular cancer evolution were investigated. Driver mutations, including RET, CBL, and DDR2 gene mutations, were identified in the hypermutated cancers. Most hypermutated endometrial and pancreatic cancer patients carry genetic mutations in EGFR, FBXW7, and PIK3CA that are linked to immunotherapy resistance, while hypermutated head and neck cancer patients carry genetic mutations associated with better treatment responses, such as ATM and BRRCA2 mutations. APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like) and DNA repair defects are mutational drivers that are signatures for hypermutated cancer. Cancer driver mutations and other mutational signatures are associated with sensitivity or resistance to immunotherapy, representing potential genetic markers in hypermutated cancers. Using computational prediction, we identified NF1 p.T700I and NOTCH1 p.V2153M as tumor-associated neoantigens, representing potential therapeutic targets for immunotherapy. Sequential mutations were used to predict hypermutated cancers based on genomic evolution. Using a logistic model, we achieved an area under the curve (AUC) = 0.93, accuracy = 0.93, and sensitivity = 0.81 in the testing set. The sequential patterns were distinct among the six cancer types, and the sequential mutation order of MSH2 and the coexisting BRAF genetic mutations influenced the hypermutated phenotype. The TP53~MLH1 and NOTCH1~TET2 sequential mutations impacted colorectal cancer survival (p-value = 0.027 and 0.0001, respectively) by reducing the expression of PTPRCAP (p-value = 1.06 × 10?6) and NOS2 (p-value = 7.57 × 10?7) in immunity. Sequential mutations are significant for hypermutated cancers, which are characterized by mutational heterogeneity. In addition to driver mutations and mutational signatures, sequential mutations in cancer evolution can impact hypermutated cancers. They characterize potential responses or predictive markers for hypermutated cancers. These data can also be used to develop hypermutation-associated drug targets and elucidate the evolutionary biology of cancer survival. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of mutational patterns, including sequential mutations, and identified useful markers and therapeutic targets in hypermutated cancer patients. ? 2021 by the authors.

Hence, it is unsurprising that their current role in the pursuance or hampering of the SDGs has become critical. This study aims at providing a snapshot and comprehensive view of the progress made and prospects in the relationship between artificial intelligence technologies and the SDGs. A comprehensive review of existing literature has been firstly conducted, after which a series SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analyses have been undertaken to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats inherent to artificial intelligence-driven technologies as facilitators or barriers to each of the SDGs. Based on the results of these analyses, a subsequent broader analysis is provided, from a position vantage, to (i) identify the efforts made in applying AI technologies in SDGs, (ii) pinpoint opportunities for further progress along the current decade, and (iii) distill ongoing challenges and target areas for important advances. The analysis is organized into six categories or perspectives of human needs: life, economic and technological development, social development, equality, resources and natural environment. Finally, a closing discussion is provided about the prospects, key guidelines and lessons learnt that should be adopted for guaranteeing a positive shift of artificial intelligence developments and applications towards fully supporting the SDGs attainment by 2030. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Artificial intelligence; Emerging digital technologies; Sustainable development goals,"Economic and social effects; Planning; Sustainable development; AI Technologies; Artificial intelligence technologies; Digital technologies; Natural environments; Panoramic views; Social development; SWOT (strengths , weaknesses , opportunities and threats) analysis; Technological development; Artificial intelligence","Montes, R.; Andalusian Research Institute in Data Science and Computational Intelligence (DaSCI), Spain; 電子郵件: rosana@ugr.es",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107518477

By isolating a circuit block that is not in use from the power supply, power gating has become one of the most effective ways to reduce leakage power. During the circuit wake-up process, turning on sleep transistors simultaneously may induce an excessive surge current, which will threaten signal integrity. To avoid significant surge currents, sleep transistor wake-up sequences should be carefully designed. On the other hand, PMOS sleep transistors may suffer from the Negative-Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) effect, where the wake-up time is increased after circuit aging. Conventional fixed wake-up sequence-based methods do not consider the NBTI effect, which may result in a longer or an unacceptable wake-up time after circuit aging. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel reconfigurable circuit structure that can reconfigure the wake-up sequence and a novel NBTI-aware wake-up strategy to reduce the wake-up time. Our strategy first finds a set of proper wake-up sequences under different aging circumstances and then dynamically reconfigures wake-up sequences at runtime based on an actual aging scenario (i.e. different months or years of aging). The experimental results show that compared with a traditional fixed wake-up sequence approach, our strategy can reduce up to 49.78% of the average wake-up time latency. In the meantime, according to our estimation, to implement the reconfigurable wake-up sequence structure, the parasitic area overhead is only about 0.27% with a larger benchmark. ? 2021 Elsevier B.V.",NBTI effect; Power gating; Sleep transistor; Wake-up sequence; Wake-up strategy,Leakage currents; Negative bias temperature instability; Reconfigurable hardware; Sleep research; Transistors; Area overhead; Circuit blocks; Leakage power consumption; Reconfigurable; Reconfigurable circuits; Sequence structure; Signal Integrity; Sleep transistors; Wakes,"Lin, I.-C.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: iclin@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107330340

Accurate pattern diagnosis requires reliable and valid diagnostic instruments that guide the collection of TCM clinical data without bias. This study synthesised the existing TCM diagnostic instruments for functional dyspepsia (FD) and appraised their quality regarding their development process and measurement properties. Methods: Seven electronic databases were searched for validation studies on TCM diagnostic instruments for FD. Synthesis and appraisal of the included studies were performed following the COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) Initiative guidelines adapted for TCM diagnostic instruments. Risk of bias assessment was conducted using the COSMIN Risk of Bias Checklist. Results: Five studies were included, with five unique TCM diagnostic instruments for FD identified. All five diagnostic instruments were of inadequate quality in terms of their development process, implying a shortcoming in their relevance, comprehensibility, and comprehensiveness. Only the criterion validity of Stomach Qi Deficiency Pattern Assessment Scale was of sufficient quality and had no risk of bias in its validation. Conclusion: The quality of TCM diagnostic instruments for FD warrants urgent improvements. None of them was considered reliable or valid for guiding TCM pattern diagnosis. To support the evidence base of the standardization of TCM patterns in ICD-11, TCM diagnostic instruments should be developed and validated rigorously under the COSMIN guidelines. Amendments should be made on the guidelines to accommodate the features and uniqueness of TCM diagnostic process. ? 2020",Chinese traditional; Dyspepsia; Medicine; Psychometrics; Surveys and questionnaires; Systematic review; Validation study,adolescent; adult; aged; Chinese medicine; criterion related validity; diagnostic test accuracy study; digestive system disease assessment; digestive system function disorder; dyspepsia; evaluation study; female; human; ICD-11; male; middle aged; Review; risk assessment; Stomach Qi Deficiency Pattern Assessment Scale; systematic review,"Chung, V.C.; School of Public Health and Primary Care, Room 413, Hong Kong; 電子郵件: vchung@cuhk.edu.hk",English,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101406797

This study aims to improve our understanding of the genomic landscape of advanced endometrial cancer and identify potential therapeutic targets. The clinical and genomic profiles of 81 patients with stage III or IV endometrial cancer were integrated. To identify genomic aberrations associated with clinical outcomes, Cox proportional hazard regression was used. The impacts of the genomic aberrations were validated in vitro and in vivo. The mutation status of MET, U2AF1, BCL9, PPP2R1A, IDH2, CBL, BTK, and CHEK2 were positively correlated with poor clinical outcomes. MET mutations occurred in 30% of the patients who presented with poor overall survival (hazard ratio, 2.606; 95% confidence interval, 1.167~5.819; adjusted p-value, 0.067). Concurrent MET and KRAS mutations presented with the worst outcomes. MET mutations in hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-binding (58.1%) or kinase (16.2%) domains resulted in differential HGF-induced c-MET phosphorylation. Different types of MET mutations differentially affected tumor growth and displayed different sensitivities to cisplatin and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

In our system, a realistic human model of the trainee is provided in virtual reality (VR). At the same time, abdominal movements are sensed, and the breathing rate can be visualized. Being aware of the breathing rate, the trainee can regulate his or her breathing to achieve a slower breathing rate. An additional source of tactile feedback is combined with visual feedback to provide a more immersive experience for the trainees.

This study used the Taiwan national database between 1995 and 2013 to examine the data of patients with cluster A PDs, cluster B PDs, or cluster C PDs. We compared the differences of psychiatric comorbidities classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition across the three clusters of PDs. Moreover, we formed gender subgroups of the three PDs to observe the discrepancy between male and female. Among the 9845 patients, those with cluster A PDs had the highest proportion of neurodevelopmental disorders, schizophrenia and neurocognitive disorders, those with cluster B PDs demonstrated the largest percentage of bipolar disorders, trauma and stressor disorders, feeding and eating disorders, and substance and addictive disorders, and those with cluster C PDs had the greatest proportion of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorders, somatic symptom disorders, and sleep–wake disorders. The gender subgroups revealed significant male predominance in neurodevelopmental disorders and female predominance in sleep–wake disorders across all three clusters of PDs. Our findings support that some psychiatric comorbidities are more prevalent in specified cluster PDs and that gender differences exist across the three clusters of PDs.

We estimated the relative risk ratios (RR) of each illness in each MOB relative to that in the general population and assessed the periodicity, with six further sensitivity analyses. Second, we searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane for related articles through 31 December 2020.

Winter births had significant risks of schizophrenia (1.04), bipolar I disorder (1.02), and major depressive disorder (1.01), and autumn births had a significant risk of alcohol use disorder (1.02). No significant associations between season of birth and Alzheimer's disease, or eating disorders were found. Conclusions: MOB is related to the risks of certain MDs. This finding provides a reference for future research on the etiology of MDs. ? 2021 The Authors.

We propose to visually analyze the anatomical variants of the liver vessels anatomy to maximize similarity for finding a suitable Living Donor-Recipient (LDR) pair. Liver vessels are segmented from computed tomography angiography (CTA) volumes by employing a cascade incremental learning (CIL) model. Our CIL architecture is able to find optimal solutions, which we use to update the model with liver vessel CTA images. A novel ternary tree based algorithm is proposed to map all the possible liver vessel variants into their respective tree topologies. The tree topologies of the recipient's and donor's liver vessels are then used for an appropriate matching. The proposed algorithm utilizes a set of defined vessel tree variants which are updated to maintain the maximum matching options by leveraging the accurate segmentation results of the vessels derived from the incremental learning ability of the CIL. We introduce a novel concept of in-order digital string based comparison to match the geometry of two anatomically varied trees. Experiments through visual illustrations and quantitative analysis demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art. ? 1964-2012 IEEE.",computed tomography angiography; Image enhancement; incremental learning; liver transplantation; liver variants; ternary tree representation; vessels segmentation,"Computerized tomography; Topology; Computed tomography angiography; Incremental learning; Liver transplant; Maximum matchings; Optimal solutions; Pair matching; Segmentation results; State of the art; Trees (mathematics); adult; algorithm; article; comparative effectiveness; computed tomographic angiography; controlled study; geometry; human; image enhancement; learning; liver blood vessel; liver graft; living donor; quantitative analysis; angiography; diagnostic imaging; liver; liver transplantation; x-ray computed tomography; Angiography; Humans; Liver; Liver Transplantation; Living Donors; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","Sheng, B.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, China; 電子郵件: shengbin@sjtu.edu.cn",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099541122

A Chinese version of the 10-item CESD was used as the outcome measure. Three social indicators (population density, divorce rate, and crime rate) and three economic indicators (unemployment rate, per capita disposable income, and per capita government expenditures) at the ecological level were examined. Results showed that two social environments and two economic features were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. However, the effects of these factors were different by gender and age groups. The economic environments were critical for males and young adults aged 20–44 years old, whereas the social environments were significant for females and middle-aged and older adults. Intervention efforts for depression prevention should integrate ecological approaches into the effects of social-economic environments on depressive symptoms. ? 2021 by the authors.

Participants were given an actigraphy device (ACT) and asked to continuously wear it for seven consecutive days, for objective data collection. Following this period, they filled out the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Questionnaire (PSQI) to collect subjective data on sleep quality. The correlation results showed that, for breast cancer patients, PSQI sleep duration was moderately correlated with ACT total sleeping time (TST) (r = ?0.534, p < 0.05), and PSQI daytime dysfunction was related to ACT efficiency (r = 0.521, p < 0.05).

In many applications such as style learning and transfer, mimicking painting, and painting authentication, it is highly desired to quantitatively and accurately identify brushstroke characteristics from old masters' pieces using computer programs. However, due to the nature of hundreds or thousands of intermingling brushstrokes in the painting, it still remains challenging. This article proposes an efficient algorithm for brush Stroke extraction based on a Deep neural network, i.e., DStroke. Compared to the state-of-the-art research, the main merit of the proposed DStroke is to automatically and rapidly extract brushstrokes from a painting without manual annotation, while accurately approximating the real brushstrokes with high reliability. Herein, recovering the faithful soft transitions between brushstrokes is often ignored by the other methods. In fact, the details of brushstrokes in a master piece of painting (e.g., shapes, colors, texture, overlaps) are highly desired by artists since they hold promise to enhance and extend the artists' powers, just like microscopes extend biologists' powers. To demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed DStroke, we perform it on a set of real scans of paintings and a set of synthetic paintings, respectively. Experiments show that the proposed DStroke is noticeably faster and more accurate at identifying and extracting brushstrokes, outperforming the other methods. ? 2021 ACM.",Brushstroke extraction; hard and soft segmentation; painting authentication; Pix2Pix network,Application programs; Deep neural networks; Extraction; Textures; Brush stroke; High reliability; High-efficiency; Manual annotation; Soft-transition; State of the art; Painting,,English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107963684

A surrogate modeling method is used, and the resulting production process model can be applied to predict the optimal manufacturing process parameters. We used different methods in this paper, including linear regression, random forests, support vector regression, multilayer perception, and a simplified VGG model to build such a surrogate model.

To make the respective model more generalizable to other tasks, we have also added a predictive network to predict the risk of conflict events. We use multitasking to render the characteristics of movies and voices more generalizable to other similar tasks. We also propose several methods to integrate video features and audio features, improving the reasoning performance of the model. There’s a model we proposed is called the video and audio reasoning Network (VARN) which is more accurate than other models. Compared with RandomNet, it achieves a 2.9 times greater accuracy. ? 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Computer vision; Deep learning; Multitask learning; Video reasoning,Computer programming; Software engineering; Audio features; Learning technology; Multimedia data; Reasoning performance; Social events; Video classification; Video features; Video summaries; Deep learning,"Horng, G.-J.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: grojium@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098696134

To improve the machining accuracy and reduce the cutting time, the cutting feed rate will have a significant impact. Therefore, how to plan a dynamic cutting feed rate is very important. In this study, a fuzzy control system for feed rate scheduling based on the curvature and curvature variation is proposed. The proposed system is implemented in actual cutting, and to verify the data an optical three-dimensional scanner is used to measure the cutting trajectory of the workpiece. Experimental results prove that the proposed fuzzy control system for dynamic cutting feed rate scheduling increases the cutting accuracy by 41.8% under the same cutting time; moreover, it decreases the cutting time by 50.8% under approximately the same cutting accuracy. ? 2021 by the authors.

If these failures occur in industrial automated production systems, the malfunctioning system can cause significant economic losses due to unacceptable fabrication quality and yield. Although preventive maintenance is a useful way to avoid such a situation, executing preventive maintenance on a frequent basis will also introduce significant production line downtime. To accurately execute the preventive maintenance just before circuit failure occurs, a chip remaining lifetime estimation method is in demand. In this paper, we propose a framework for predicting the remaining lifetime of the chip. This framework can adapt to changes in the process and operating voltage. The framework tracks representative aging indicators through machine learning methods in order to predict the remaining lifetime of the chip.

The FM contains numerous items (50), which reduces its clinical usability. The purpose of this study was to develop a short form of the FM for people with stroke using a machine-learning methodology (FM-ML) and compare the efficiency (ie, number of items) and psychometric properties of the FM-ML with those of other FM versions, including the original FM, the 37-item FM, and the 12-item FM. Methods: This observational study with follow-up used secondary data analysis. For developing the FM-ML, the random lasso method of ML was used to select the 10 most informative items (in terms of index of importance). Next, the scores of the FM-ML were calculated using an artificial neural network. Finally, the concurrent validity, predictive validity, responsiveness, and test-retest reliability of all FM versions were examined. Results: The FM-ML used fewer items (80% fewer than the FM, 73% fewer than the 37-item FM, and 17% fewer than the 12-item FM) to achieve psychometric properties comparable with those of the other FM versions (concurrent validity: Pearson r = 0.95-0.99 vs 0.91-0.97; responsiveness: Pearson r = 0.78-0.91 vs 0.33-0.72; and test-retest reliability: Intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.88-0.92 vs 0.93-0.98). Conclusion: The findings preliminarily support the efficiency and psychometric properties of the 10-item FM-ML.

Our architecture improves the performance of the conventional unidirectional architecture by reducing the total number of sorting cycles via bidirectional sorting along with two auxiliary methods. Bidirectional sorting allows the sorting tasks to be conducted concurrently in the high-and low-index parts of our architecture. The first auxiliary method is boundary finding, which shortens the range for index searching by finding the boundaries of the range. The second auxiliary method is queue storing, which stores each useful index in a queue in advance to reduce the number of miss cycles during index searching. The performance of our architecture highly depends on the distribution of input data. For each set of input data to be sorted, five Gaussian distributions of the input data and four standard derivations for each distribution were adopted in our experiments. The results show that at the expense of some additional area cost, the number of sorting cycles and the energy consumption are significantly reduced by our method. ? 2004-2012 IEEE.",Bidirectional; Hardware; Sorting; Very large-scale integration (VLSI),Energy utilization; Input output programs; Area cost; Input datas; Low index; Sorting algorithm; Sorting,"Chen, P.-Y.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: pychen@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099733813

With the use of two sublayers, the LBCNN has lower computational complexity and uses less memory than the CNN. In this brief, we propose a platform that includes a weight preprocessor and layer accelerator for the LBCNN.

However, it is intractable to simulate olfactory features (such as the intensity and the direction) with multiple levels. Visual stimuli have been proved to dominate human perception among multiple sensors in virtual environments. If visual stimuli can be used to guide the olfactory sense in VR, the design of the olfactory display can be simpler but still able to provide olfactory experience with more diversity. To understand the visual-olfactory effect on different olfactory characteristics, a portable olfactory display that can control the intensity and direction of odors was developed. An experimental study was conducted to investigate cross-modal human perception, i.e. how the visually virtual odor representation in VR influences human perception of real odor produced by the proposed olfactory display. The results showed that the perception of odor intensity and directionality can be modulated by visually virtual odor representation. ? 2021 IEEE.",Olfactory display; Virtual reality,Odors; User interfaces; Human perception; Multiple levels; Multiple sensors; Olfactory characteristics; Olfactory display; Olfactory effect; Olfactory sense; Visual stimulus; Virtual reality,"Tsai, S.-E.; National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan; 電子郵件: s104060025@m104.nthu.edu.tw",English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106495682

To date, there are not many adequate studies that have investigated the feasibility of a wearable wrist device for the continuous monitoring of body surface temperatures in humans. Objective: The objective of this study was to validate the performance of HEARThermo, an innovative wearable device, which was developed to continuously monitor the body surface temperature in humans. Methods: We implemented a multi-method research design in this study, which included 2 validation studies-one in the laboratory and one with human subjects. In validation study I, we evaluated the test-retest reliability of HEARThermo in the laboratory to measure the temperature and to correct the values recorded by each HEARThermo by using linear regression models. We conducted validation study II on human subjects who wore HEARThermo for the measurement of their body surface temperatures. Additionally, we compared the HEARThermo temperature recordings with those recorded by the infrared skin thermometer simultaneously. We used intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman plots to analyze the criterion validity and agreement between the 2 measurement tools. Results: A total of 66 participants (age range, 10-77 years) were recruited, and 152,881 completed data were analyzed in this study. The 2 validation studies in the laboratory and on human skin indicated that HEARThermo showed a good test-retest reliability (ICC 0.96-0.98) and adequate criterion validity with the infrared skin thermometer at room temperatures of 20°C-27.9°C (ICC 0.72, P<.001). The corrected measurement bias averaged -0.02°C, which was calibrated using a water bath ranging in temperature from 16°C to 40°C. The values of each HEARThermo improved by the regression models were not significantly different from the temperature of the water bath (P=.19). Bland-Altman plots showed no visualized systematic bias. HEARThermo had a bias of 1.51°C with a 95% limit of agreement between -1.34°C and 4.35°C. Conclusions: The findings of our study show the validation of HEARThermo for the continuous monitoring of body surface temperatures in humans. ?

Based on different symptoms of the patient, needling or massaging is applied to the corresponding acupuncture points to relieve the symptoms. However, given the large number of acupuncture points and the complexity of their specifities, it is difficult for one to remember the location and function of each acupuncture point without extensive training. In this work, through the use of augmented reality (AR), the acupuncture points can be displayed directly on the image of human body. Compared to existing acupoint probe devices that work by measuring the skin conductivity, our solution does not require any additional hardware and is purely software-based.

However, a packet may match more than one flow entry due to the intra-table dependency phenomenon among flow entries. Moreover, different packets may incur different conflicting flow entries under the intra-table dependency. Forwarding packets by the first-match scheme for prioritized flow entries may not always produce the best outcome. Thus, an online conflict detection procedure executed for each incoming packet is needed to flag the conflicts to network administrators. In addition, the SDN controller may frequently update the service provisioning policies that are specified in the flow entries and deliver them to the switches in a large OpenFlow-based environment. This needs a high-performance conflict detection mechanism to support real-time updating. However, performing conflict detection within a large flow table will be very time consuming. This paper first develops a graph-based multilevel redundancy reduction scheme to construct highly compact matching trees that will be used in conflict detection for a large flow table. Then, a conflict detection algorithm with higher performance and lower cost, the Compact Bit Vector algorithm (CBV), is proposed. The performance of the CBV has been validated through an extensive mathematical performance analysis followed by simulations, with good results in terms of requiring less time for the search, lower memory requirement and lower incremental updating time. Obviously, the CBV is very suitable for the conflict detection task of a large and frequently updated flow table. ? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Bit vector algorithm; Conflict detection; OpenFlow; Software-defined networking,Graphic methods; Trees (mathematics); Bit-vector algorithms; Conflict detection algorithms; Incremental updating; Lower memory requirement; Mathematical Performance; Minimization methods; Network administrator; Redundancy reductions; Flow graphs,"Kuo, Y.-H.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: kuoyh@ismp.csie.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098502011

There is the network situation that it may have multiple target destinations of the next network to the moving vehicle, which is called as Mobile Node (MN), can handover in vehicular networks. Therefore, it requires to make a suitable handover decision based on both the networking loading and MN's received signal strength. Although there are several studies applying Software Defined Network (SDN) to DMM for improving the performance of existed DMM-based schemes, the current network-based handover approaches still endure the high handover latency and high signaling cost. In this paper, a Load-Considered Handover Control Scheme for Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) using Software Defined Network (SDN) over the vehicular environment, which is called as LC-SDN-DMM, that can support the handover decision and let MN be able to complete the handover preparation before MN disconnecting from the currently serving Mobility Anchor and Access Router (MAAR) to the next suitable MAAR, was proposed. LC-SDN-DMM also can support selecting the suitable next anchor router through the assistance of the SDN Controller. The simulation analysis has proved that the proposed LC-SDN-DMM approach has better handover performance than the conventional DMM approach regarding to throughput, handover delay and packets loss. ? 2021 IEEE.",Distributed Mobility Management (DMM); Handover; Mobility Management; Software Defined Network (SDN); Vehicular Network,Environmental management; Mobile telecommunication systems; Software defined networking; Distributed mobility managements; Handover decision; Handover performance; Received signal strength; Simulation analysis; Vehicular environments; Vehicular mobilities; Vehicular networks; 5G mobile communication systems,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101972825

Accordingly, we propose a learning-based template matching (LbTM) algorithm in which the accuracy of the matching results is improved by clearing the matching scores of these confused pixels or patches to zero using a spatial clustering process. This algorithm consists of two modules: First, the translation matching module uses the learning-based pairwise similarity matrix. Having determined the center coordinate of the target object, the second module is applied to estimate the target rotation angle by using a Siamese network. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated for 600 template-rotated target pairs. It is shown that the area under curve (AUC) performance of the proposed algorithm (0.678) is higher than that of three other template matching algorithms (DDIS, CoTM, and QATM). Moreover, our algorithm achieves a minimum success rate of 80% in practical grasping trials performed even using high-aspect objects with various rotational angles and positions. ? 2021 IEEE.",,Aspect ratio; Clustering algorithms; Learning algorithms; Pixels; Robotic arms; Clustering process; High aspect ratio; Matching process; Matching score; Matchings; Pairwise similarity matrix; Robot arms; Similarity scores; Spatial clustering; Template-matching algorithms; Template matching,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124301793

Because they perform similar biological functions, proteins in the same family usually share similar structural characteristics. We employed this premise in designing a classification algorithm. In this algorithm, auxiliary graphs are used to represent proteins, with every amino acid in a protein to a vertex in a graph. Moreover, the links between amino acids correspond to the edges between the vertices. The proposed algorithm classifies proteins according to the similarities in their graphical structures.

Without network's congestion status, ECMP may cause significant imbalance between paths. In this paper, we propose a better congestion aware routing protocol for Software Defined Network (SDN) to provide a better average link utilization. We follow the idea of In-band Network Telemetry (INT) to collect link congestion status in data center networks. Edge switches are responsible for detecting elephant flows by running a heavy hitter detection algorithm. When an elephant flow is reported to the controller by an edge switch, controller will use the collected congestion status to find the least congested path. In order to make the switches forward packets more efficiently and reduce the number of rules in switches' forwarding table, we adopt label switching. We develop a Programming Protocol-independent Packet Processors (P4) program to design our novel routing scheme, which contains a heavy hitter detection algorithm. We further validate that our heavy hitter detection algorithm can run on Banzai machine. We also write a Python controller to communicate with P4 switches through P4 Runtime protocol. Our experimental results shows that the probing process in CAMP minimizes the bandwidth overhead in data centers. We use Mininet to construct fat-tree topologies and the emulated software P4switches run BMv2. The data mining workload is used to generate the traffic in our experiment.

Also, the number of routing rules in CAMP maintains the smallest when network grows. ? 2021 IEEE.",Elephant Flow Detection; Fat-Tree; In-Band Network Telemetry; Load Balancing; P4; SDN,Balancing; Controllers; Data mining; Routing protocols; Signal detection; Telemetering equipment; Elephant flow; Elephant flow detection; Equal-cost-multi-paths; Fat trees; Flow detection; In-band; In-band network telemetry; Load-Balancing; Multi-paths routing; Software-defined networks; Program processors,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123179575

The d-claw vertex deletion problem, d-CLAW-VD, asks for a given graph G and an integer k whether one can delete at most k vertices from G such that the resulting graph has no d-claw as an induced subgraph. Thus, 1-CLAW-VD and 2-CLAW-VD are just the famous vertex cover problem and the cluster-vd problem, respectively. In this paper, we show that cluster-vd remains NP -complete when restricted to bipartite graphs of maximum degree?3. Moreover, for every d? 3, we show that d-CLAW-VD is NP -complete even when restricted to bipartite graphs of maximum degree d. These hardness results are optimal with respect to degree constraint.

Nonetheless, providing pieces of evidence to explain why a suspicious tweet is rumor is essential. As such, a novel model, LOSIRD, was proposed in this paper. First, LOSIRD mines appropriate evidence sentences and classifies them by automatically checking the veracity of the relationship of the given claim and its evidence from about 5 million Wikipedia documents. LOSIRD then automatically constructs two heterogeneous graph objects to simulate the propagation layout of the tweets and code the relationship of evidence. Finally, a graphSAGE processing component is used in LOSIRD to provide the label and evidence. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first one who combines objective facts and subjective views to verify rumor. The experimental results on two real-world Twitter datasets showed that our model exhibited the best performance in the early rumor detection task and its rumor detection performance outperformed other baseline and state-of-the-art models.

However, the performance of these methods degrades dramatically when insufficient training data are available. To address this challenging problem, we propose a few-shot object re-identification (FSOR) method that enhances the generalization and discrimination abilities of object Re-ID models trained on small datasets. This method applies two novel techniques: Reparameterization for feature vectors and dual-distance metric learning. The reparameterization mechanism transforms the primary feature vector of each input image into a Gaussian distribution to enhance the robustness of the FSOR method when performing object Re-ID tasks. The dual-distance metric learning technique, called HC learning, considers both the hard mining distance and the center-point distance between each query sample and each support set of different object identities. HC learning extracts the characteristics of the entire training dataset more precisely than other approaches and thus improves the discriminative abilities of object Re-ID models. Extensive experiments on both person and vehicle Re-ID datasets, such as Market-1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, CUHK03, and VeRi-776, show that the FSOR method has improved performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods when the amount of labeled training data is small. ? 2013 IEEE.",Few-shot learning; Metric learning; Object re-identification; Visual recognition,Image enhancement; Large dataset; Distance Metric Learning; Dual distance; Few-shot learning; Identification method; Metric learning; Object re-identification; Re identifications; Reparameterization; Training dataset; Visual recognition; Learning systems,"Kuo, Y.-H.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: kuoyh@ismp.csie.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116986066

The mechanisms of demand-side management are thus proposed to reduce the consumption while electricity companies forecast the appearance of excessive peak load which may incur the instability of electrical grids. However, DSM solutions are generally devised as the way of compulsively controlling home appliances but the interruption is not a pleasurable mechanism. To address this issue, we figure out an advertising strategy based on the residential electricity data acquired from smart meters. By recommending preference-related coupons to residents, we can induce residents to go outside to use the coupon while helping the peak load reduction with pleasure, leading to the win-win result between users and electricity companies. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called DMAR, which combines the directed inference and the mediated inference to infer residents’ preferences based on their electricity usage. Through experimental studies on the real data of smart meters from the power company, we demonstrate that our method can outperform other baselines in the preference inference task. Meanwhile, we also build a line bot system to implement our advertisement service for the real-world residents.

However, in predicting the disease type and disease-gene associations, scholars face two essential challenges, namely the vast number of existing variants and the existence of variants which are recognized as variant of uncertain significance (VUS). To tackle these challenges, we propose algorithms to assign a significance to each gene rather than each variant, describing its degree of pathogenicity. Since the interpreters identified most of the variants as VUS, most of the gene scores were identified as uncertain significance. To predict the uncertain significance scores, we design two matrix factorization-based models: the common latent space model uses genomics variant data as well as heterogeneous clinical data, while the single-matrix factorization model can be used when heterogeneous clinical data are unavailable.We have managed to show that the models successfully predict the uncertain significance scores with low error and high accuracy. Moreover, to evaluate the effectiveness of our novel input features, we train five different multi-label classifiers including a feedforward neural network with the same feature set and show they all achieve high accuracy as the main impact of our approach comes from the features.

However, most existing image deblurring methods require a large amount of paired training data and fail to maintain satisfactory structural information, which greatly limits their application scope. In this paper, we present an unsupervised image deblurring method based on a multi-adversarial optimized cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). Although original CycleGAN can handle unpaired training data well, the generated high-resolution images are probable to lose content and structure information. To solve this problem, we utilize a multi-adversarial mechanism based on CycleGAN for blind motion deblurring to generate high-resolution images iteratively. In this multi-adversarial manner, the hidden layers of the generator are gradually supervised, and the implicit refinement is carried out to generate high-resolution images continuously. Meanwhile, we also introduce the structure-aware mechanism to enhance the structure and detail retention ability of the multi-adversarial network for deblurring by taking the edge map as guidance information and adding multi-scale edge constraint functions. Our approach not only avoids the strict need for paired training data and the errors caused by blur kernel estimation, but also maintains the structural information better with multi-adversarial learning and structure-aware mechanism. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmarks have shown that our approach prevails the state-of-the-art methods for blind image motion deblurring. ? 1992-2012 IEEE.",edge refinement; multi-adversarial; structure-aware; Unsupervised image deblurring,Convolutional neural networks; Iterative methods; Adversarial learning; Adversarial networks; Blur kernel estimations; Content and structure; Guidance information; High resolution image; State-of-the-art methods; Structural information; Image enhancement; article; kernel method; learning; motion,"Sheng, B.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, China; 電子郵件: shengbin@sjtu.edu.cn",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112032696

A set M of vertices of a graph G is a distance-edge-monitoring set if for every edge e of G, there are a vertex x of M and a vertex y of G such that e belongs to all shortest paths between x and y. We denote by dem(G) the smallest size of such a set in G. The vertices of M represent distance probes in a network modeled by G; when the edge e fails, the distance from x to y increases, and thus we are able to detect the failure. It turns out that not only we can detect it, but we can even correctly locate the failing edge. In this paper, we initiate the study of this new concept. We show that for a nontrivial connected graph G of order n, 1?dem(G)?n?1 with dem(G)=1 if and only if G is a tree, and dem(G)=n?1 if and only if it is a complete graph. We compute the exact value of dem for grids, hypercubes, and complete bipartite graphs. Then, we relate dem to other standard graph parameters. We show that dem(G) is lower-bounded by the arboricity of the graph, and upper-bounded by its vertex cover number. It is also upper-bounded by twice its feedback edge set number. Moreover, we characterize connected graphs G with dem(G)=2. Then, we show that determining dem(G) for an input graph G is an NP-complete problem, even for apex graphs.

However, the ultrasound (US) image quality and operator experience affect the accuracy. We present an automatic system that enables precise fetal MSP detection from three-dimensional (3D) US and provides an evaluation of its performance using a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework. Method: The neural network is designed as a filter and generates masks to obtain the MSP, learning the features and MSP location in 3D space. Using the proposed image analysis system, a seed point was obtained from 218 first-trimester fetal 3D US volumes using deep learning and the MSP was automatically extracted. Results: The experimental results reveal the feasibility and excellent performance of the proposed approach between the automatically and manually detected MSPs. There was no significant difference between the semi-automatic and automatic systems. Further, the inference time in the automatic system was up to two times faster than the semi-automatic approach. Conclusion: The proposed system offers precise fetal MSP measurements. Therefore, this automatic fetal MSP detection and measurement approach is anticipated to be useful clinically. The proposed system can also be applied to other relevant clinical fields in the future. ? 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

First, by considering the effectiveness of deep multi-task learning, we jointly estimated four weather properties on the basis of the same visual information. Second, we propose that weather property estimations considering temporal evolution can be conducted from two perspectives, i.e., day-wise or hour-wise.

In previous studies, only few emotion recognition systems consider nonverbal vocalization, which naturally exists in our daily conversation. In this work, both verbal and nonverbal sounds within an utterance are considered for emotion recognition of real-life affective conversations. Firstly, a support vector machine (SVM)-based verbal and nonverbal sound detector is developed. A prosodic phrase auto-tagger is further employed to extract the verbal/nonverbal sound segments. For each segment, the emotion and sound feature embeddings are respectively extracted using the deep residual networks (ResNets). Finally, a sequence of the extracted feature embeddings for the entire dialog turn are fed to an attentive long short-term memory (LSTM)-based sequence-to-sequence model to output an emotional sequence as recognition result. The NNIME corpus (The NTHU-NTUA Chinese interactive multimodal emotion corpus), which consists of verbal and nonverbal sounds, was adopted for system training and testing. 4766 single speaker dialogue turns in the audio data of the NNIME corpus were selected for evaluation. The experimental results showed that nonverbal vocalization was helpful for speech emotion recognition.

It is a powerful signal processing tool and has received increasing attention in recent years. SpEn has been successfully applied in biomedical measurements and other applications. In particular, many emerging applications require measuring the SpEn of signals in real-time embedded systems. However, the standard implementation of SpEn requires a computational complexity of O(n2), where n is the data length, making it difficult to meet real-time constraints, especially for large n. Moreover, power consumption and computation latency must be considered as well. The data length used in previous studies was approximately several hundred, and it remains a challenging task to operate on longer data lengths. In this article, we propose the assisted sliding box (SBOX) algorithm to accelerate the computation of SpEn without any approximation while maintaining a low memory overhead so that the algorithm can be executed in embedded systems for edge computing. We also develop an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based wearable device for comfortable overnight recording. The SBOX algorithm is then implemented in the system to measure the online SpEn of an overnight sleep EEG signal. The results show that, compared with the standard algorithm, the SBOX algorithm speeds up the computation time by a factor of 60, thereby reducing power consumption by 98% when measuring a 30-s epoch of sleep EEG with n=7500 and a 250-Hz sampling rate. ? 1963-2012 IEEE.",Computation time; edge computing; microcontroller (MCU); sample entropy (SpEn); sleep electroencephalogram (EEG); wearable device,Approximation algorithms; Costs; Electric power utilization; Electroencephalography; Entropy; Online systems; Real time systems; Signal processing; Sleep research; Wearable computers; Biomedical measurements; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Emerging applications; On-line analysis; Real time constraints; Real-time embedded systems; Standard algorithms; Wearable devices; Embedded systems,"Wang, Y.-H.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: yunghung@ncu.edu.tw

However, online quality estimation is challenging because high-frequency stream data derived from in situ metrology have to be processed in a timely manner to figure out the complicated interactions among material, machine, and part. To tackle such issue, this article proposes an intelligent AM metrology (IAMM) architecture to decouple and evaluate quality variations caused by material properties, machine issues, and process parameters when building an AM part. The IAMM architecture can also estimate the online layer-to-layer quality (e.g., roughness and density of an AM part) by applying the robust parameters derived from the uniform design (UD) method via the enhanced automatic virtual metrology technology in a parallel computing environment, as soon as the microfeatures of melt-pools and the macrofeatures of each layer are extracted. In addition, the associated indices and features in the IAMM architecture can also be used to evaluate the defects caused by machine issues in the given process parameters. The results of case studies validate the applicability of the IAMM architecture and show that the proposed estimation models are prospective for future closed-loop control in an AM process. Note to Practitioners - The proposed intelligent AM metrology (IAMM) architecture can be implemented modularly in a metal additive manufacturing (AM) machine that possesses the capability of estimating the coating and printing qualities of the AM process by extracting features from the optical data of the melt pools and chamber layer by layer. The estimated indices and qualities can be derived online using parallel computation to timely diagnose the machine issues and control the process of the next layer. Hence, when an AM machine is equipped with the IAMM architecture, it can efficiently manufacture a 3-D part with reduced defects in real time. ? 2020 IEEE.",Automatic virtual metrology (AVM); in situ metrology; intelligent AM metrology (IAMM) architecture; meltpool; metal additive manufacturing,3D printers; Additives; Closed loop control systems; Data streams; Defects; Frequency estimation; Lakes; Closed-loop control; Extracting features; High frequency HF; In-situ metrology; Parallel Computation; Parallel-computing environment; Process parameters; Quality estimation; Process control,"Yang, H.-C.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: hao@nkust.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099346497

In 2003, a baseline survey for 10-item attitudes toward aging scale consisting of widely different domains across financial relationships with children, grandparenting, living arrangements, and remarriage was conducted. Later, physical disabilities, including mobility and activities of daily living (ADL) limitations, were evaluated in 2007. A total of 1635 participants aged 57 and over were analyzed. Older age, self-rated poor health, and those suffering from pain were found to be more likely to have higher risk of physical disabilities. The older adults who expressed a willingness to receive financial support from their adult children were reported to have a lower risk of mobility limitations (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50–0.90), while those who did not want to assist with child care as grandparents had a higher risk of ADL difficulties (aOR: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.31–4.60).

Regarding the lack of Taiwanese text corpus, this paper translates Mandarin corpus into Taiwanese corpus based on word-to-word translation. Moreover, additional translation rules for codeswitching text are manually designed. The augmented text corpus is then used for training the code-switching language models.

The main task is to generate a shorter version based on the original text and maintain relevant information. This paper studies multi-document summarization (MDS) that applies to news articles. MDS has two significant issues which are information overlap and information difference among multiple articles. Existing models mostly deal with MDS from the perspective of single document summarization (SDS). The models do not consider the relation between sentences in multiple news articles. Our proposed method deals with the issue and consists of two models. The sentence selector model selects representative sentences based on the entailment relation in different articles. The content is related to the event of the article extracted through the algorithm. The summary generator model generates a final summary to ensure that the summary contains no redundancy and maintains vital information. Experiment results show that our proposed model has effectively improved in the evaluation results. The main contribution of our approach is to use the entailment relation to obtain key content in multiple articles. Adding semantic comprehension can identify salient information clearly and improve the accuracy of MDS. ? 2020 IEEE.,abstractive summarization; entailment relation; multi-document summarization,Artificial intelligence; Semantics; Text processing; Automatic text summarization; Evaluation results; Generator modeling; Multi-document summarization; NAtural language processing; News articles; Semantic comprehension; Single document summarization; Natural language processing systems,"Kao, H.-Y.; National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan; 電子郵件: hykao@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103813914

Then, we leveraged both the hard targets and the soft targets as the objective for training a much smaller student model to perform extractive summarization.

According to a report by McKinsey Global Institute, there will be 1 trillion IoT devices connected to the Internet by 2025. Faced with a large variety of IoT devices, it is necessary to use software-defined networking (SDN) to solve the connection problem of IoT devices. Nevertheless, the size of the flow table of the switch in SDN is limited, and it cannot accommodate all flow entries of all passing traffic. Therefore, an effective flow entry management scheme is needed to reduce the controller processing delay and signal overhead. In general networks, a suggestion of delaying installation is proposed, which can reduce the number of flow entries. However, this will increase the controller processing delay and reduce the quality of service. Two pre-installation methods designed for IoT were proposed, PFIM and EPFIM. Both of them can reduce the controller processing delay by detecting the periodicity of traffic and pre-installing flow entries. However, they cannot detect multiple periodicities. In addition, there is still room for improving the accuracy of periodic detection and reducing the signal overhead. In this paper, we propose a subflow-based proactive flow installation mechanism. We design a new data collection method to improve the accuracy of pre-installation. We also design a new data structure to be able to detect multiple periodicities in a single flow. An algorithm is proposed to implement accurate periodic calculation. Our mechanism can fit with arbitrary periodic traffic patterns and has been proven to be highly accurate and efficient. ? 2020 IEEE.",Flow Table Management; IoT; SDN,Controllers; Cost reduction; Installation; Quality of service; Data collection method; General networks; Installation methods; Internet of thing (IOT); Management scheme; Periodic calculations; Periodic detections; Software defined networking (SDN); Internet of things,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102209174

In order to combat this disease, researchers from all over the world, including computer scientists, are beginning to engage in cross-regional cooperation to conduct research on SARS-CoV-2. One of the latest reports pointed out that the sequence deletion of the specific region of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic is related to its viral infectivity. In addition, the sequence deletion of this specific region is also found in Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), and Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Through next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, the sequence data of biological genomes can be quickly obtained, but the number of short reads generated by NGS is often as high as one million big data. It is a challenge to detect the information necessary to provide the exact sequence deletion breakpoint from these NGS data, especially in the sequence data of highly variable viral genomes. In our previous research, we proposed VirDelect, a bioinformatics tool that can detect exact breakpoints in Viral NGS data. In this paper, a new method, One-base Alignment Plus (OAP), is proposed to enhance further the core VirDelect algorithm, in order to improve the sequence deletion detection correctness. We use the simulated data of SARS-CoV-2 and HBV with different deletion lengths and the real data of HBV to conduct experiments and evaluate the correctness.

With software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV), various scenarios can be implemented in the 5G network. Cloud computing, for example, is one of the important application scenarios for implementing SDN/NFV solutions. The emerging container technologies, such as Docker, can provide more agile service provisioning than virtual machines can do in cloud environments. It is a trend that virtual network functions (VNFs) tend to be deployed in the form of containers. The services provided by clouds can be formed by service function chaining (SFC) consisting of containerized VNFs. Nevertheless, the challenges and limitation regarding SFCs are reported in the literature. Various network services are bound to rely heavily on these novel technologies, however, the development of related technologies often emphasizes functions and ignores security issues. One noticeable issue is the SFC integrity. In brief, SFC integrity concerns whether the paths that traffic flows really pass by and the ones of service chains that are predefined are consistent. In order to examine SFC integrity in the cloud-native environment of 5G network, we propose a framework that can be integrated with NFV management and orchestration (MANO) in this work. The core of this framework is the anomaly detection mechanism for SFC integrity. The learning algorithm of our mechanism is based on extreme learning machine (ELM). The proposed mechanism is evaluated by its performance such as the accuracy of our ELM model. This paper concludes with discussions and future research work. ? 2020 IEEE.",5G network; anomaly detection; cloud-native; extreme learning machine; service function chaining; service integrity,Anomaly detection; Containers; Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Network function virtualization; Queueing networks; Transfer functions; Application scenario; Cloud environments; Detection mechanism; Extreme learning machine; Native environment; Network services; Service functions; Software defined networking (SDN); 5G mobile communication systems,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102173085

Automatic fake news detection can classify fake news and help the society to clarify the information is true or false without human checking. Detecting fake news by analyzing the stance is one of the mainstream methods, stance detection has become a new popular research field in recent years. How to accurately detect stance has become the primary goal of detecting fake news. This research aims to detect the news stance accurately, and we propose a method based on a pre-trained BERT language model. Most of the previous work only used the knowledge of single inference direction when classifying the stance, which may lose some important information. Therefore, we propose a bidirectional inference stance detection model, which can leverage bidirectional perspective information to classify the stance more comprehensively. We also define the stance detection task as a hierarchical structure task, and use the hierarchical classification and incorporate the topic information to help the stance classification. Experiment results show that our model can classify the stance more accurately. ? 2020 IEEE.",bidirectional perspective; pretrained model; Stance detection; topic model,Fake detection; Bidirectional perspective; Detection models; Detection tasks; Hierarchical structures; Language model; Online news; Pretrained model; Research fields; Stance detection; Topic Modeling; Classification (of information),"Kao, H.-Y.; National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan; 電子郵件: hykao@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100023188

The behavioral results showed the clear modulation of significant others’ preferences onto one’s own decisions, and the contrast of the “shop-together vs. shop-alone”, and the “congruent (both liked or disliked the item, 68%) vs. incongruent (one liked but the other disliked, and vice versa)” together trials, both revealed bilateral temporal parietal junction (TPJ) among other reward-related regions, likely reflecting mentalizing during preference harmony.

In this study, a streaking detection method is proposed for evaluating and optimizing quantitative susceptibility maps. Methods: Nine healthy subjects participated in this study and underwent three-dimensional multi-echo gradient echo scans. Regularized iterative algorithm was used for reconstruction of tissue susceptibility maps in all subjects. Streaking detection was applied to evaluate streaking artifact in tissue susceptibility maps. In addition, an optimization process for QSM reconstruction by streaking detection was applied and was compared with matching noise level method. Results: It is shown that the proposed streaking detection technique effectively delineates streaking artifact in tissue susceptibility maps. In QSM reconstruction, optimization by streaking detection successfully determines the regularization factor that balances between streaking artifact suppression and tissue texture preservation. ROI analyses of brain tissue susceptibility show that optimization by streaking detection achieves results in good agreement with that from matching noise level method. Conclusions: Streaking detection enables direct visualization of streaking patterns in tissue susceptibility maps. It can be applied both for evaluating QSM reconstruction quality and for comparing different reconstruction algorithms. Furthermore, streaking detection can be incorporated into an optimization process of QSM reconstruction. Therefore, we conclude that the proposed method will add value to reconstruction of QSM. ? 2020 American Association of Physicists in Medicine",dipole inversion; Hough transform; quantitative Susceptibility Mapping; streaking artifact; tissue magnetic susceptibility,"Image reconstruction; Iterative methods; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mapping; Textures; Tissue; Artifact suppression; Direct visualization; Image reconstruction methods; Iterative algorithm; Reconstruction algorithms; Reconstruction quality; Susceptibility mapping; Susceptibility maps; Tissue engineering; adult; article; artifact reduction; brain tissue; clinical article; controlled study; dipole; female; Hough transform; human; human experiment; magnetism; male; noise; quantitative analysis; reconstruction algorithm; algorithm; artifact; brain; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; image enhancement; image processing; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Algorithms; Artifacts; Brain; Brain Mapping; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Wu, M.-L.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, No. 1, University Road, Taiwan; 電子郵件: minglong.wu@csie.ncku.edu.tw

Methodology: This study consisted of 288 subjects aged 40 years and above. The ten-year probability of major osteoporotic fractures (MOF) and hip fractures was assessed using the FRAX? algorithm with bone mineral density (BMD) data. A logistic regression was used to determine risk factors related to a high probability of major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture. Results: The median 10-year probability of fracture was 3.7% (IQR 2.2–6.2) for MOF and 0.8% (IQR 0.3–2.5) for hip fractures. In addition to old age, previous fracture history, and low T-scores, HCV co-infection was associated with a higher risk of hip fractures in PLWH (AOR: 4.3, 95% CI: 1.29–14.33). Old age and low T-scores were also associated with a high probability of MOF. Conclusions: HCV co-infection among PLWH is associated with a higher risk of hip fracture.

Intratumor heterogeneity may foster the resistant subclones and leads to cancer recurrence. Here, we built a cancer evolution model and applied machine learning analysis to identify potential therapeutic targets. Among 78 CRC cases, whole-genome (WGS) and deep targeted sequencing data generated from paired blood and primary tumor were used for phylogenetic tree reconstruction. Genetic alterations in the PI3K/AKT, and RTK oncogenic signaling pathways were commonly detected in founding clones. The dominant subclones frequently exhibited dysregulations in the TP53, FBXW7/NOTCH1 tumor suppression, and DNA repair pathways. Fourteen genetic mutations were simultaneously selected by random forest and LASSO methods. The logistic regression model had better accuracy (79%), precision (70%), and recall (65%) and area under the curve (AUC) (82%) for cancer recurrence prediction. Three genes, including MYO18A in the founding clone, FBXW7, and ATM in the dominant subclone, affected the prognosis were selected simultaneously by different feature sets. The in vitro studies, HCT-116 cells transfected with MYO18A siRNA demonstrated a significant reduction in cell migration activity by 20–40%. These results indicate that MYO18A plays a crucial role in the migration of human CRC cells. The cancer evolution model revealed the critical mutations in the founding and dominant subclones. They can be used to predict clinical outcomes and the development of novel therapeutic targets for stage III CRC. ?

The additional computation capability and extensive network coverage provides energy-limited smart devices with more opportunities to enable IoV system for time-sensitive applications. However, when implemented in a vision-based driver assistance system, the transmission of a large amount of redundant data not only causes delay but also severely compromises the accuracy of object detection. In this paper, an improved object detection algorithm based on video key-frame for latency reduction on edge IoV system is proposed. It can significantly improve latency reduction performance at the expense of small detection accuracy. In our proposal, we adopt an important coefficient and frame similarity comparison algorithm to filter redundant frames and achieve key frames for object detection. Then an improved Haar-like feature based classification algorithm is used for object detection under the edge computation model.

To address the high screening workload at quarantine stations, all staff members with medical licenses are required to work shifts in these stations. Therefore, it is necessary to simplify the workflow and decision-making process for physicians and surgeons from all subspecialties. Objective: The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the National Cheng Kung University Hospital artificial intelligence (AI) trilogy of diversion to a smart quarantine station, AI-assisted image interpretation, and a built-in clinical decision-making algorithm improves medical care and reduces quarantine processing times. Methods: This observational study on the emerging COVID-19 pandemic included 643 patients. An “AI trilogy” of diversion to a smart quarantine station, AI-assisted image interpretation, and a built-in clinical decision-making algorithm on a tablet computer was applied to shorten the quarantine survey process and reduce processing time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The use of the AI trilogy facilitated the processing of suspected cases of COVID-19 with or without symptoms; also, travel, occupation, contact, and clustering histories were obtained with the tablet computer device. A separate AI-mode function that could quickly recognize pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-rays was merged into the smart clinical assisting system (SCAS), and this model was subsequently trained with COVID-19 pneumonia cases from the GitHub open source data set. The detection rates for posteroanterior and anteroposterior chest x-rays were 55/59 (93%) and 5/11 (45%), respectively. The SCAS algorithm was continuously adjusted based on updates to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control public safety guidelines for faster clinical decision making. Our ex vivo study demonstrated the efficiency of disinfecting the tablet computer surface by wiping it twice with 75% alcohol sanitizer. To further analyze the impact of the AI application in the quarantine station, we subdivided the station group into groups with or without AI. Compared with the conventional ED (n=281), the survey time at the quarantine station (n=1520) was significantly shortened; the median survey time at the ED was 153 minutes (95% CI 108.5-205.0), vs 35 minutes at the quarantine station (95% CI 24-56; P<.001). Furthermore, the use of the AI application in the quarantine station reduced the survey time in the quarantine station; the median survey time without AI was 101 minutes (95% CI 40-153), vs 34 minutes (95% CI 24-53) with AI in the quarantine station (P<.001). Conclusions: The AI trilogy improved our medical care workflow by shortening the quarantine survey process and reducing the processing time, which is especially important during an emerging infectious disease epidemic. ?Ping-Yen Liu, Yi-Shan Tsai, Po-Lin Chen, Huey-Pin Tsai, Ling-Wei Hsu, Chi-Shiang Wang, Nan-Yao Lee, Mu-Shiang Huang, Yun-Chiao Wu, Wen-Chien Ko, Yi-Ching Yang, Jung-Hsien Chiang, Meng-Ru Shen.",Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Quarantine station; SARS-CoV-2; Smart device assisted decision making,"adult; artificial intelligence; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; epidemiology; female; human; isolation hospital; middle aged; pandemic; procedures; quarantine; questionnaire; Taiwan; virus pneumonia; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Hospitals, Isolation; Humans; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan","Shen, M.-R.; Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 138 Sheng-Li Rd, Taiwan; 電子郵件: mrshen@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092945532

The main ideas of the recursive algorithm are to construct large trees from small trees, use triangle breadth-first search (TBFS) to build a frame of an IST, and use breadth-first search (BFS) to link the rest of the nodes. The main ideas of the parallel algorithm are to build frames through TBFS in parallel, and to use the specific rules to link the rest of the nodes in parallel. We prove the correctness of both algorithms for constructing ISTs in AN n. Both algorithms are accurate; furthermore, the parallel algorithm is more ecient than the recursive algorithm.

Using the proposed system, the root handheld device plays the role of an MEC server and is charge of downloading POIs' contents from the remote cloud server using 4G/5G cellular network and then forwarding POIs' contents to other group members' handheld devices using device-to-device (D2D) communication. Since the number of connected handheld devices in each handheld device is limited using D2D communication, this work proposed a control scheme called k-Connection-Limited and n-Hop (kCL-nH) tree topology's construction scheme to achieve the proximate sharing of POIs' contents. Additionally, since the root handheld device consumes more battery power than others, this work proposed a control scheme that has each group member's handheld device to be the root handheld device alternatively. A credit scheme was thus proposed to denote each handheld device's contribution, which is referred for the selecting of the next root handheld device, to achieve the fairness concern. Then, the control scheme, which is executed in the corresponding MEC server, considering both remaining battery power and credit for the switching of the root handheld device was designed.

Knowing how to nap for brain benefits is important. We designed a nap experiment to investigate how napping after different sleep stages impacts procedural memory and sleepiness. In total, 45 nonhabitual nappers were randomly assigned to the Wake group (no napping), N2 group (napping and being woken after enough N2 sleep), and slow-wave sleep (SWS) group (napping and being woken after the end of the first cycle of slow-wave sleep). The results show that the N2 group produces benefits in procedural memory consolidation and sleepiness reduction. In contrast, the SWS group had a lower behavioral performance than the N2 group and their sleepiness. The Wake group had lower performance and higher sleepiness score than the other groups. The results suggest that the ideal napping time is 10-20 min of N2 sleep. Considering that people's sleep-onset time might be different, we developed a napping time suggestion system using a single-channel electroencephalogram signal. The testing results show that the difference between a 10-min nap of N2 sleep calculated by our system and by an expert is only 0.45 min on average, which demonstrates the feasibility of waking people up at the right time. ? 2016 IEEE.",Electroencephalogram (EEG); enhancement; finger tapping; motor; napping; procedural memory; sequential finger movements; sleep inertia; sleepiness,Brain; Slow wave structures; Wakes; Behavioral performance; Brain activity; First cycle; Onset-time; Procedural memory; Single channel eeg; Sleep stage; Slow wave; Sleep research,"Kuo, C.-E.; Department of Automatic Control Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: cekuo@fcu.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085125067

Therefore, nonvolatile memory (NVM) with high capacity is being actively developed. A hybrid memory that comprises both NVM and DRAM and provides both high access speed and nonvolatility has become a major trend. However, compared to DRAM, NVM in the hybrid memory typically suffers from a shorter lifetime and higher latency. To improve the lifetime and address the latency issues associated with hybrid memory, we propose a global clean page first replacement (GCPF) to reduce the write operations to NVM. We also propose an index-aware multistream prefetcher (IAMSP) that considers the indexes of prefetch candidates individually so as to prefetch pages from NVM more accurately. Benchmarks with a large memory footprint are used to evaluate the proposed schemes. The experimental results show that GCPF enhances lifetime by 56.8% as compared to LRU, on average. When applying prefetching schemes on GCPF, the lifetime is insignificantly degraded. In addition, IAMSP reduces DRAM misses by 42.0% as compared to LRU, while a modern prefetcher that can change the prefetch degree dynamically only reduces DRAM misses by 38.0%, on average. When applying both GCPF and IAMSP, the average access latency can be reduced by 28.8% as compared to LRU. ? 1982-2012 IEEE.",DRAM; endurance; hybrid memory; latency; NAND flash; nonvolatile memory (NVM); prefetching; replacement policy,Durability; Dynamic random access storage; Flash memory; Nonvolatile storage; Hybrid memory; Latency; NAND Flash; Non-volatile memory; Prefetching; Replacement policy; Memory architecture,"Lin, I.-C.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: iclin@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068566585

Due to the divergent software dependencies of the reported approaches, the developed methods are rarely compared or reproduced. Objective: The goal of the research was to generate reproducible machine learning modules for lung cancer detection and compare the approaches and performances of the award-winning algorithms developed in the Kaggle Data Science Bowl. Methods: We obtained the source codes of all award-winning solutions of the Kaggle Data Science Bowl Challenge, where participants developed automated CT evaluation methods to detect lung cancer (training set n=1397, public test set n=198, final test set n=506). The performance of the algorithms was evaluated by the log-loss function, and the Spearman correlation coefficient of the performance in the public and final test sets was computed. Results: Most solutions implemented distinct image preprocessing, segmentation, and classification modules. Variants of U-Net, VGGNet, and residual net were commonly used in nodule segmentation, and transfer learning was used in most of the classification algorithms. Substantial performance variations in the public and final test sets were observed (Spearman correlation coefficient = .39 among the top 10 teams).

There is a lack of research on the truth-telling experience and needs in the intensive care unit from the perspective of patient family members. PURPOSE: This study is designed to explore the experiences and needs of families in the intensive care unit. METHODS: A descriptive phenomenology method was used in this study. In-depth interviews were conducted with five participants who had family members assessed with acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II scores ? 20. Data were analyzed using Giorgi's phenomenological methods and Nvivo 11. RESULTS: Four experience themes were examined, including (1) nothing is clear, requires explanation; (2) helpless to find answers, need a nurse to resolve this issue; (3) professional conduct makes us feel helpless, longing for love from the medical team; (4) decisions are very difficult, hoping to get more help. CONCLUSIONS / IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The family members expressed that they were unable to understand the underlying causes of the progression in patient condition because the medical team only presented outcomes to the family and did not discuss related causes. Thus, it is recommended that medical teams learn to recognize the cognitive processes of patient family members and consider their emotions, including their needs and expectations, in order to provide individualized explanations based on a patient's status and progress.",family needs; intensive care unit; phenomenology; truth-telling,family; human; human relation; intensive care unit; interpersonal communication; needs assessment; physician; psychology; qualitative research; Family; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Needs Assessment; Physicians; Professional-Family Relations; Qualitative Research; Truth Disclosure,,Chinese,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089063104

However, existing post-processing techniques for rendering DOF effects introduce visual artifacts such as color leakage, blurring discontinuity, and the partial occlusion problems which limit the application of DOF. Traditionally, occluded pixels are ignored or not well estimated although they might make key contributions to images. In this paper, we propose a new filtering approach which takes approximated occluded pixels into account to synthesize the DOF effects for images. In our approach, images are separated into different layers based on depth. Besides, we utilize adaptive PatchMatch method to estimate the intensities of occluded pixels, especially in the background region. We again propose a new multilayer-neighborhood optimization to estimate occluded pixels contributions and render the images. Finally, we apply gathering filter to achieve the rendered images with elite DOF effects. Multiple experiments have shown that our approach can handle color leakage, blurring discontinuity and partial occlusion problem while providing high-quality DOF rendering effects. ? 1995-2012 IEEE.",Depth of field; multilayer; neighborhood optimization; rendering,Multilayers; Pixels; Artistic effects; Background region; Depth of field; Different layers; Partial occlusions; Post-processing techniques; Rendered images; Visual artifacts; Rendering (computer graphics),"Sheng, B.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, China; 電子郵件: shengbin@sjtu.edu.cn",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077737605

Therefore, the median can be obtained without any comparators. With this feature, the area cost drops significantly while the operating speed remains the same.

In diagnostic evaluation on the outpatients with mood disorder, a large portion of BD patients are initially misdiagnosed as having UD [2]. As most previous research focused on long-term monitoring of mood disorders, short-term detection which could be used in early detection and intervention is thus desirable. This work proposes an approach to short-term detection of mood disorder based on the patterns in emotion of elicited speech responses. To the best of our knowledge, there is no database for short-term detection on the discrimination between BD and UD currently. This work collected two databases containing an emotional database (MHMC-EM) collected by the Multimedia Human Machine Communication (MHMC) lab and a mood disorder database (CHI-MEI) collected by the CHI-MEI Medical Center, Taiwan. As the collected CHI-MEI mood disorder database is quite small and emotion annotation is difficult, the MHMC-EM emotional database is selected as a reference database for data adaptation. For the CHI-MEI mood disorder data collection, six eliciting emotional videos are selected and used to elicit the participants' emotions. After watching each of the six eliciting emotional video clips, the participants answer the questions raised by the clinician. The speech responses are then used to construct the CHI-MEI mood disorder database. Hierarchical spectral clustering is used to adapt the collected MHMC-EM emotional database to fit the CHI-MEI mood disorder database for dealing with the data bias problem. The adapted MHMC-EM emotional data are then fed to a denoising autoencoder for bottleneck feature extraction. The bottleneck features are used to construct a long short term memory (LSTM)-based emotion detector for generation of emotion profiles from each speech response. The emotion profiles are then clustered into emotion codewords using the K-means algorithm. Finally, a class-specific latent affective structure model (LASM) is proposed to model the structural relationships among the emotion codewords with respect to six emotional videos for mood disorder detection. Leave-one-group-out cross validation scheme was employed for the evaluation of the proposed class-specific LASM-based approaches. Experimental results show that the proposed class-specific LASM-based method achieved an accuracy of 73.33 percent for mood disorder detection, outperforming the classifiers based on SVM and LSTM. ? 2010-2012 IEEE.",latent affective structure model; Mood disorder; speech emotion recognition,Database systems; Diagnosis; Diseases; Extraction; Feature extraction; K-means clustering; Long short-term memory; Speech recognition; Emotion recognition; Mental disorders; Mood; Mood disorders; Speech emotion recognition; Structure modeling; Videos; Speech,"Huang, K.-Y.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: iamkyh77@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041845344

We examined infant cries evoked by vaccinations and analyse the volume and types of audio frequency fluctuation of the cries. The Infant Temperament Questionnaire is filled out by the parents. Statistical analyses of t-tests and ANOVA were performed using the software SPSS 16.0. The intensity of infants’ reactions varied significantly with their home environments (p <.01). Infants from noisier home environments reacted more intensely. Whether infants were breastfed significantly correlated with the rhythmicity of their physiological cycle (p =.046). Breastfed infants indicated a higher level of rhythmicity. The number of seconds taken by the parent to comfort the infant significantly correlated with the infants’ persistence (p =.029). The types of cries significantly correlated with infants’ distractibility (p =.028). Infants whose cries became softer were more difficult to distract. Infants whose cries became louder or remained steady were easier to distract.

In comparison with the current available medical modalities, the contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging is the simplest and fastest means for probing the tissue perfusion. Specifically, the perfusion parameters estimated from the ultrasound time-intensity curve (TIC) and statistics-based time–Nakagami parameter curve (TNC) approaches were found able to quantify the perfusion. However, due to insufficient tolerance on tissue clutters and subresolvable effects, these approaches remain short of reproducibility and robustness. Consequently, the window-modulated compounding (WMC) Nakagami parameter ratio imaging was proposed to alleviate these effects, by taking the ratio of WMC Nakagami parameters corresponding to the incidence of two different acoustic pressures from an employed transducer. The time–Nakagami parameter ratio curve (TNRC) approach was also developed to estimate perfusion parameters. Measurements for the assessment of muscle perfusion were performed from the flow phantom and animal subjects administrated with a bolus of ultrasound contrast agents. The TNRC approach demonstrated better sensitivity and tolerance of tissue clutters than those of TIC and TNC. The fusion image with the WMC Nakagami parameter ratio and B-mode images indicated that both the tissue structures and perfusion properties of ultrasound contrast agents may be better discerned. ? 2020 by the authors.

Although several studies have explored this phenomenon, the prevalence and incidence rate of fracture were varied. Objective The aim of the study is to determine and analyze the pooled prevalence, incidence rate of fracture and fracture risk factors among people living with HIV (PLWH). Methods PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL with full Text, and Medline databases for studies published up to August 2019 were searched. Studies reporting the prevalence or incidence of fracture among PLWH were included. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) appraisal tool. A meta-analysis with random-effects model was performed to determine pooled estimates of prevalence and incidence rates of fracture. A meta-regression was performed to determine the source of heterogeneity. Results The pooled estimated prevalence of fracture among PLWH was 6.6% (95% CI: 3.8–11.1) with pooled odds ratio of 1.9 (95%CI: 1.1–3.2) compared to the general population. The pooled estimates of fracture incidence were 11.3 per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 7.9–14.5) with incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 1.5 (95% CI: 1.3–1.8) compared to the general population. Risk factors for fracture incidence were older age (aHR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.3–1.6), smoking (aHR 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1–1.5), HIV/HCV co-infection (aHR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.3–1.9), and osteoporosis (aHR 3.3, 95% CI: 2.2–5.1). Conclusions Our finding highlights a higher risk of fracture among PLWH compared to the general population. Osteoporosis, smoking and HIV/HCV coinfection as the significant modifiable risk factors should be prioritized by the HIV health providers when care for PLWH. ? 2020 Pramukti et al.

What is the average of merchandise imports plus exports of the countries neighboring China? Do the merchandise imports plus exports of these countries correspond to each country’s own merchandise imports plus exports or liner shipping connectivity index (LSCI)? Design/methodology/approach: The authors spatially analyze liner shipping connectivity and merchandise imports plus exports using 2016 data and a common framework for linear regression to establish the relationship amongst a country’s LSCI and its merchandise imports plus exports and between its merchandise imports plus exports and those of its neighbors. Merchandise imports plus exports of countries are not necessarily independent of each other, and countries that are contiguous may produce similar observations. Findings: North America and Western Europe comprised clusters of countries that participated more actively in the international trading system, while Africa’s countries had less international trade than average. The study identifies and quantifies the geographical ripple of transport infrastructure on merchandise trade from a national perspective. Notably, a spatially lagged term improved the model’s ability to account for variations in merchandise imports plus exports across countries. Originality/value: The spatial lag of merchandise imports plus exports can contribute to specifying the spread of merchandise imports plus exports beyond what the authors would anticipate from a country’s network of liner shipping. ? 2020, Pacific Star Group Education Foundation.",Liner shipping connectivity index; Merchandise trade; Spatial lag,,"Lin, P.-C.; Department of Transportation and Communication Management Science, Taiwan; 電子郵件: peichunl@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085210548

Additionally, we divided the whole image into several blocks for processing to obtain superior detection performance. It can efficiently prevent missing the real edge in low-contrast regions. The VLSI architecture of our design yields a processing rate of approximately 250 MHz using the Xilinx Virtex-5 field-programmable gate array.

First, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based universal background model (UBM) is constructed to generate acoustic feature (AC) embedding. In addition, as the articulatory features (AFs) represent some important phonological properties during speech production, a multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based AF embedding extraction model is also constructed for AF embedding extraction. The extracted AC and AF embeddings are concatenated as a combined feature vector for speaker identification using a fully-connected neural network. This proposed system was evaluated by three corpora consisting of King-ASR, LibriSpeech and SITW, and the experiments were conducted according to the properties of the datasets. We adopted all three corpora to evaluate the effect of AF embedding, and the results showed that combining AF embedding into the input feature vector improved the performance of speaker identification. The LibriSpeech corpus was used to evaluate the effect of the number of enrolled speakers. The proposed system achieved an EER of 7.80% outperforming the method based on x-vector with PLDA (8.25%).

In the alignment process, a machine vision technique is used to detect the fiducial marks and then adjust the position of the vision system in such a way that it is aligned with the PCB. The present study proposed an embedded PCB alignment system, in which a rotation, scale and translation (RST) template-matching algorithm was employed to locate the marks on the PCB surface. The coordinates and angles of the detected marks were then compared with the reference values which were set by users, and the difference between them was used to adjust the position of the vision system accordingly. To improve the positioning accuracy, the angle and location matching process was performed in refinement processes. To overcome the matching time, in the present study we accelerated the rotation matching by eliminating the weak features in the scanning process and converting the normalized cross correlation (NCC) formula to a sum of products. Moreover, the scanning time was reduced by implementing the entire RST process in parallel on threads of a graphics processing unit (GPU) by applying hash functions to find refined positions in the refinement matching process. The experimental results showed that the resulting matching time was around 32× faster than that achieved on a conventional central processing unit (CPU) for a test image size of 1280 × 960 pixels.

The changing weather, e.g., cloudiness or haze formed from atmospheric suspended particles, results in low contrast satellite images, and partial information about Earth’ s surface is lost. Therefore, this study proposes an effective dehazing method for one single satellite image, aiming to enhance the image contrast and filter out the region covered with haze, so as to reveal the lost information. First, the initial transmission map of the image is estimated using an Interval Type-2 Recurrent Fuzzy Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (IT2RFCMAC) model. For the halo and color oversaturation resulted from the processing procedure, a bilateral filter and quadratic function nonlinear conversion are used in turn to refine the initial transmission map. For the estimation of atmospheric light, the first 1% brightest region is used as the color vector of atmospheric light. Finally, the refined transmission map and atmospheric light are used as the parameters for reconstructing the image. The experimental results show that the proposed satellite image dehazing method has good performance in the visibility detail and color contrast of the reconstructed image. In order to further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, visual assessment and quantitative evaluation were implemented, respectively, and compared with the methods proposed by relevant scholars. The visual assessment and quantitative evaluation analysis demonstrated good results of the proposed approach. ? 2020 by the authors.

Dynamic virtual machine VM consolidation, as one of the effective methods for reducing energy energy consumption is extensively employed in large cloud data centers. It achieves the energy reductions by concentrating the workload of active hosts and switching idle hosts into low-power state; moreover, it improves the resource utilization of cloud data centers. However, the quality of service (QoS) guarantee is fundamental for maintaining dependable services between cloud providers and their customers in the cloud environment. Therefore, reducing the power costs while preserving the QoS guarantee are considered as the two main goals of this study. To efficiently address this problem, the proposed VM consolidation approach considers the current and future utilization of resources through the host overload detection (UP-POD) and host underload detection (UP-PUD). The future utilization of resources is accurately predicted using a Gray-Markov-based model. In the experiment, the proposed approach is applied for real-world workload traces in CloudSim and were compared with the existing benchmark algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches significantly reduce the number of VM migrations and energy consumption while maintaining the QoS guarantee. ? 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Cloud computing; Cloud data centers; Dynamic virtual machine (VM) consolidation; Utilization prediction model,Cloud computing; Computer aided software engineering; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Network security; Quality of service; Virtual machine; Cloud data centers; Information explosion; Overload detection; Prediction model; Quality of service (QoS) guarantees; Resource utilizations; Utilization of resources; Virtual machine consolidations; Green computing,"Hsieh, S.-Y.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, No.1 University Road, Taiwan; 電子郵件: hsiehsy@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079666795

Specifically, the requirement of minimizing the overlapping among paths, which is a NP-hard issue, is highly demanded in applications of disaster rescue management such as the evacuation plan. In this paper, we consider the deployment of k-discriminative paths for various applications, including queries for emergency-purpose applications, queries of multi-objective Pareto front for pre-schedule transportation plan, and queries with multiple sources and destinations for the regional evacuation. Due to its NP-hard nature, the heuristic strategy based on the ant colony optimization is devised in this work.

First, an equivalent mathematical model of the singular analog system is presented to simulate the time response of continuous-time linear singular analog systems to arbitrary inputs via the model conversion method. Then, for the unknown singular analog system, it constructs a linear quadratic analog trackerwith state feedback and feed-forward gains based on the off-lineOKIDmethod. Furthermore, it extends the designmethodology of the EID estimator for strictly proper regular systemswith unknownmatched-mismatched input and output disturbances to proper regular systems. It is important to mention that the newly developed modified functional observer for proper systems is used to estimate the unknown EID of singular analog systems and that the constraints on the dimensions of unknown disturbances can be eliminated by using the newly proposed EID estimation method. The contributions of this paper can be listed as follows: (1) based on both the OKID method and the discrete-to-continuous model conversion, the simulation of the time responses of the continuous-time linear singular models (which are not feasible using existing MATLAB toolboxes) become feasible; (2) for effective control of the unknown singular analog system, an off-line OKID method is proposed to design an LQAT with state feedback and feed-forward gains; and (3) based on the newly developed modified functional observer for the reduced-order proper regular system, the original EID estimator in the literature is newly extended to estimate the EID from the unknown strictly proper singular analog system, without the original dimensional constraints of the disturbances.

To sustain such business model, the establishment of a data service platform for IoT data sharing and data service delivery becomes a necessity. Today, blockchain-based platforms are believed to be reliable but have poor system performance, considerable storage overheads and high energy consumption. MEC technology is then applied to help IoT devices participate in the blockchain network. However, the considerable loading of blockchain operations turns MEC hosts into a performance bottleneck, instead. Therefore, this paper exploits the hierarchical blockchain architecture in the proposed IoT data service platform, called HB-IoDS, to significantly reduce the storage overheads and service providing time. Furthermore, to alleviate the heavy burdens on MEC hosts, HB-IoDS provides the adaptive Proof-of-Work (APoW) consensus algorithm that derives an appropriate difficulty to achieve PoW condition according to device capability. By this mean, resource-constrained IoT devices can also perform blockchain operations which are usually regarded as energy-consuming. Finally, simulation results show that HB-IoDS outperforms existing blockchain-based platforms in terms of system performance, energy consumption, and storage costs. As a result, the proposed HB-IoDS is the most practical IoT data service platform. ? 2020 ACM.",Blockchain; Data service; Internet of things,Blockchain; Data Sharing; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Storage as a service (STaaS); Business modeling; Consensus algorithms; Device capabilities; High energy consumption; Performance bottlenecks; Service-providing; Storage costs; Storage overhead; Internet of things,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086144647

However, more intensive computation complexity is introduced by implementing the flexible quad tree-structured coding model. In a typical HEVC encoder, coding units (CUs) in a coding tree unit (CTU) that is built as a quad-tree structure are recursively traversed each depth level (CU size) to select the optimal coding configuration. Therefore, most of the encoding time is spent searching for the optimal coding configuration. In this paper, an efficient and fast CU size decision algorithm is proposed to reduce HEVC encoder complexity by the spatiotemporal features. First, an adaptive depth-range prediction method minimizes the possible range depth level by observing previous frames and proximal CTUs. Second, an early termination method based on the boundary examination from the de-blocking filter (DBF) prevents unnecessary calculation on small CU sizes. Furthermore, according to the sum of absolution difference (SAD), a smooth area detection mechanism is triggered when the predictive depth range excludes the largest CU size. This mechanism increase the bitrate of the CU, which contains static objects with complex textures. Compared with the HM 16, the experimental results revealed that the proposed algorithm can achieve an average 59.73% and 64.98% reduction in encoding time along with a 0.68% and 1.27% Bjontegaard Delta bitrate (BDBR) penalty for various test videos under low-delay P and random-access conditions, respectively. ? 1963-12012 IEEE.",CU size decision; HEVC,Efficiency; Encoding (symbols); Image coding; Signal encoding; Silicon compounds; Textures; Trees (mathematics); Advanced video coding; Computation complexity; Decision algorithms; Encoder complexity; HEVC; High-efficiency video coding; Spatio temporal features; Video coding standard; Video signal processing,"Kuo, Y.-T.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: danny80929@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081955648

Deep learning is parallel and suitable for distributed computing, which can significantly improve the system throughput. However, there is a bottleneck for cross-machine training, that is, network latency. Nodes frequently need to wait for synchronization, and the content of each synchronization may range from several megabytes to hundred megabytes. Thus, network communication takes considerable time in the training process, which reduces system performance. Therefore, many computing architectures have been proposed. This paper proposes a type of distributed computing system for deep learning. Our design aims to reduce synchronization times and network blocking times by using a new cache mechanism, called cache pre-forwarding. The design concept of cache pre-forwarding aims to exploit reinforcement learning to train a pre-forwarding policy to increase the cache hit rate. Because of the features of reinforcement learning, our policy is adaptive and applicable to different computing environments. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that our system is feasible. ? 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cache, Reinforcement learning; Deep learning; Distributed computing",Computer architecture; Distributed computer systems; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Reinforcement learning; Synchronization; Computing architecture; Computing environments; Distributed computing systems; Machine trainings; Network communications; Network latencies; Real world domain; System throughput; Deep learning,"Horng, G.-J.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: grojium@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078699789

Methods: Women diagnosed with breast cancer, who had completed their primary treatment but less than 5 years without a sign of recurrence (N = 165) were randomized to a SCP-A or a control group. Self-reported questionnaires were completed by the both groups at baseline (T0), 5 weeks (T1), 3 months (T2), 6 months (T3), and 12 months (T4). Results: Controlling for relevant covariates, mixed effect model analyses revealed a significant decrease in women in the SCP-A group compared to the control group for total unmet needs since T3 (p < .004) and fear of recurrence since T4 (p = .02). Women in the SCP-A group also reported significant improvements in QoL at T4 (p < .001) relative to those in the control group.

By the user similarities, the unknown ratings can be predicted using user-based Collaborative Filtering (CF). For dealing with problems of rating sparsity and new items, the unknown ratings are initialized by acoustic features and music genre ratings. Because the unknown ratings are initially imputed, the rating data will be enriched. Thereupon, the user preference can be predicted effectively by item-based CF.

We present an approach based on illumination decomposition that recovers the intrinsic images without additional information, e.g., depth or user interaction. Our approach is based on the rationale that the shading component contains the step and drift channels simultaneously. We decompose the illumination into two channels: the step shading, corresponding to the sharp shading changes due to cast shadow or abrupt shape changes; the drift shading, accounting for the smooth shading variations due to gradual illumination changes or slow shape changes. Due to such transformation of turning the conventional assumption that shading has smoothness as reasonable prior, our model has the advantages in handling real images, especially with the cast shadows or strong shape edges. We also apply a much stricter edge classifier along with a reinforcement process to enhance our method. We formulate the problem using a two-parameter energy function and split it into two energy functions corresponding to the reflectance and step shading.

However, this may increase the numbers of parameters and calculations in the network architecture. When the network model is applied to mobile devices and embedded systems, the storage capacity, computing performance, and memory will become major limitations. A local binary convolutional neural network (LBCNN) has been proposed to reduce the numbers of parameters and calculations. In the LBCNN, the convolutional layer of the CNN is replaced by a local binary convolution (LBC) module. In the LBC module, there is a pre-initialized fixed parametric filter layer. Since the parameters of the filter are generated in a random manner, the result is different each time and therefore unstable. Therefore, to provide a stable and efficient recognition technique for image sensors, we propose a genetic-Algorithm-based local binary convolutional neural network (GA-LBCNN) for gender recognition in this study. The genetic algorithm (GA) is used to search for the best filter parameters of the LBCNN. LeNet is adopted as the basic model architecture, and two datasets acquired from image sensors, the CIA and MORPH datasets, are used to perform face gender classification. According to the evaluation results, LBC successfully reduces the numbers of parameters and calculations. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed GA-LBCNN reaches 88.8 and 98.2% for the CIA and MORPH datasets, respectively.

In addition to use the V2V2I path's lifetime and quality to derive the suitable V2V2I offloading paths using the snapshot VANET topology on the time point of receiving X's reported context, this work proposed a scheme to derive the potential V2V2I paths that may exist in the future, i.e., in a constrained time interval, to find the better V2V2I offloading path. The performance evaluation shown that the proposed method outperforms the one that (i) only considers the data offloading path's lifetime or (ii) does not consider the candidate V2V2I offloading paths existed in the future. ? 2020 IEEE.",Delay-constrained Computing; Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC); VANET Data Offloading; Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2V2I),Computer architecture; Edge computing; Vehicle to infrastructure; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicles; Cellular network; Multiaccess; Signal coverage; Situation-aware; Time interval; Time points; Vehicle to vehicles; Vehicular ad hoc networks,,English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104985484

If, for every v ? V(G), the paths from v to the root r in T1 and T2 are internally vertex-disjoint, they are called independent spanning trees (ISTs). ISTs can be applied in numerous fields, such as fault-tolerant broadcasting and secure message distribution. The (n,k)-star graphs Sn,k constitute a generalized version of the star network. The method of constructing ISTs in (n,k)-star graphs remains unknown. In this paper, we propose one recursive algorithm and one parallel algorithm for constructing ISTs on (n,k)-star graphs. The main ideas of the recursive algorithm are to use induction to change small trees into large trees, to use a modified breadth-first search (MBFS) traversal to create a frame for an IST, and to use a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal to connect the rest of nodes. The main ideas of the parallel algorithm are to create frames through MBFS traversals in parallel, and to use some specific rules to connect the rest of nodes in parallel. We also present validation proofs for both algorithms, and analyze the time complexities of both algorithms. The time complexity of the recursive algorithm in Sn,k is O(n × (n?n!k)! ), where (n?n!k)! is the number of nodes of Sn,k. The time complexity of the parallel algorithm can be reduced to O((n?n!k)! ) if the system has n ? 1 processors computing in parallel. Both algorithms are correct with the stated time complexity values; the parallel algorithm is more efficient than the recursive algorithm. ? 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

However, because collecting labeled 3D skeletons is expensive and time-consuming, semi-supervised methods that need much fewer amount of labeled 3D data are urgently demanded. Some semi-supervised learning methods propose to independently consider information from consecutive video frames, or frames simultaneously captured from multiple viewpoints. In this article, we propose to jointly consider temporal information and multiview information in a unified adversarial learning framework. Given a 2D skeleton, a pose generator network is developed to estimate the corresponding 3D skeleton, and a camera network is developed to estimate camera parameters. The estimated 3D skeleton is evaluated by a critic network to examine whether the estimated one is a plausible 3D human pose or not. Based on the estimated camera parameters, the estimated 3D skeleton can be re-projected into a 2D skeleton, which should be similar to the input 2D skeleton. The ideas of re-projection and adversarial learning enable the scheme of self supervision. We design network architectures of the aforementioned networks to take 2D skeletons from multiple viewpoints in temporally consecutive frames. By jointly considering two types of information, we verify that performance can be largely improved. ? 2013 IEEE.",3D human pose estimation; multiview information; semi-supervised; temporal information,Cameras; Learning systems; Musculoskeletal system; Network architecture; 3D human pose estimation; Adversarial learning; Camera parameter; Human pose estimations; Multiple viewpoints; Semi-supervised learning methods; Semi-supervised method; Temporal information; Semi-supervised learning,"Chu, W.-T.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: wtchu@gs.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098913964

To address this issue, we propose a model that explores homogeneity and conversation structure to identify rumors. Our model learns more comprehensive and precise representations by modeling follower-following relationships of users, simulating the propagation layout of tweets, and connecting responders' behavior. The experimental results on two public Twitter datasets show that our model's performance outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline models.

Whereas previous studies have evaluated spatial relationships using still frame images, we aimed to train and test a deep neural network for video analysis by combining spatial and temporal information, to automate the recognition of left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities. Methods: We collected a series of transthoracic echocardiography examinations performed between July 2017 and April 2018 in 2 tertiary care hospitals. Regional wall abnormalities were defined by experienced physiologists and confirmed by trained cardiologists. First, we developed a 3-dimensional convolutional neural network model for view selection ensuring stringent image quality control. Second, a U-net model segmented images to annotate the location of each left ventricular wall. Third, a final 3-dimensional convolutional neural network model evaluated echocardiographic videos from 4 standard views, before and after segmentation, and calculated a wall motion abnormality confidence level (0-1) for each segment. To evaluate model stability, we performed 5-fold cross-validation and external validation. Results: In a series of 10 638 echocardiograms, our view selection model identified 6454 (61%) examinations with sufficient image quality in all standard views. In this training set, 2740 frames were annotated to develop the segmentation model, which achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.756. External validation was performed in 1756 examinations from an independent hospital. A regional wall motion abnormality was observed in 8.9% and 4.9% in the training and external validation datasets, respectively. The final model recognized regional wall motion abnormalities in the cross-validation and external validation datasets with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.912 (95% CI, 0.896-0.928) and 0.891 (95% CI, 0.834-0.948), respectively. In the external validation dataset, the sensitivity was 81.8% (95% CI, 73.8%-88.2%), and specificity was 81.6% (95% CI, 80.4%-82.8%). Conclusions: In echocardiographic examinations of sufficient image quality, it is feasible for deep neural networks to automate the recognition of regional wall motion abnormalities using temporal and spatial information from moving images. Further investigation is required to optimize model performance and evaluate clinical applications. ? 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Since Cayley graphs have been widely used to design interconnection networks, constructing ISTs on cayley graphs is worth studying. The alternating group network is a subclass of Cayley graphs, and the approach of constructing ISTs in alternating group networks is still unknown. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple top-down approach for constructing ISTs in alternating group networks. The main ideas of the algorithm are to use induction to develop small trees to big trees, to use a triangle breadth-first search (TBFS) process to create a backbone of an IST, and to use breadth-first search (BFS) process to connect the rest of nodes. Compared to other methods of different interconnection networks in the literature, the uniqueness of our method is that it does not need to determine the parent of one node by any rule, on the contrary others determine that by rules. The time complexity in n -dimensional alternating group network AN n is O( n2× n ), where n! is twice the number of nodes of AN n ; hence it is polynomial time. We implement the algorithm in PHP and run cases from AN 3 to AN 10. The results reveal that all spanning trees of AN 3 to AN 10 are independent and that our algorithm is accurate and efficient. ? 2013 IEEE.",alternating group networks; Cayley graph; Independent spanning trees; interconnection networks; triangle breadth-first search,Graph Databases; Interconnection networks (circuit switching); Polynomial approximation; Breadth-first search; Polynomial-time; Reliable communication; Research fields; Secure messages; Time complexity; Top down approaches; Top down construction; Trees (mathematics),"Hsieh, S.-Y.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: hsiehsy@mail.ncku.edu.tw

This is an improvement over previous models, in that the proposed approach can simultaneously achieve fluent and variable-length abstractive summarization. The proposed abstractive summarization model consists of a text segmentation module and a two-stage Transformer-based summarization module. First, the text segmentation module utilizes a pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) to divide the input text into segments. An extractive model based on the BERT-based summarization model (BERTSUM) is then constructed to extract the most important sentence from each segment. For training the two-stage summarization model, first, the extracted sentences are used to train the document summarization module in the second stage. Next, the segments are used to train the segment summarization module in the first stage by simultaneously considering the outputs of the segment summarization module and the pre-trained second-stage document summarization module. The parameters of the segment summarization module are updated by considering the loss scores of the document summarization module as well as the segment summarization module. Finally, collaborative training is applied to alternately train the segment summarization module and the document summarization module until convergence. For testing, the outputs of the segment summarization module are concatenated to provide the variable-length abstractive summarization result. For evaluation, the BERT-biLSTM-based text segmentation model is evaluated using ChWiki_181k database and obtains a good effect in capturing the relationship between sentences. Finally, the proposed variable-length abstractive summarization system achieved a maximum of 70.0% accuracy in human subjective evaluation on the LCSTS dataset. ? 2014 IEEE.",Abstractive summarization; BERT; bidirectional LSTM; text segmentation; variable-length summarization,Tunneling (excavation); Collaborative training; Document summarization; Human subjective evaluation; Model-based OPC; Summarization models; Summarization systems; Text segmentation; Two-stage methods; Long short-term memory,"Wu, C.-H.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: chunghsienwu@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087512000

In this paper, an easier option is made available when a unified SE scheme named uFETCH is proposed to accommodate both. Namely, uFETCH is able to build unified SE indexes for both the types while enabling encrypted search even if the SE indexes built for texts and numbers are mingled. To demonstrate how uFETCH can bring up simpler designs, a security agent is exemplified to work with off-the-shelf DBMS while making it privacy-preserving.

This study aimed to examine the role of resistin on inflammation and its effect on the clinical outcome of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) following catheter ablation. A total of 108 patients (56.9 ± 12.0 years, 76.8% male) with symptomatic and drug-refractory AF undergoing catheter ablation were enrolled. Inflammatory biomarkers and epicardial fat volume by contrast computed tomography (CT) images were assessed in all patients before the procedure. Baseline resistin correlated with epicardial fat volume, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and left atrial (LA) scar area. After the index procedure, the univariate analysis revealed that hypertension, persistent AF, LA diameter, and plasma resistin level were related to recurrent atrial arrhythmia. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that persistent AF, LA diameter, and plasma resistin level all independently predicted recurrent atrial arrhythmia after ablation. Plasma resistin with a level higher than 777 (pg/mL) could predict recurrence following catheter ablation of AF. High plasma resistin level is associated with poor left atrial substrate, high epicardial fat volume, and elevated TNF-α level in patients with AF.

First, a complete evaluation model that takes the data trading profile and reputation into consideration is proposed for both suppliers and demanders to assess the trustworthiness of their trading partners. Second, a client-centric data value evaluation model and a game-theory-based pricing model are used to promote win-win transactions in which the demanders obtain higher quality data at an acceptable price and the suppliers receive higher profits.

Experiments demonstrate that our representation method is superior to several state-of-the-art methods and as good as JPEG, while providing real-time editability and preserving structural and irregular saliency information. ? 1999-2012 IEEE.",hybrid vector representation; real-time editability; Real-time vector graphics; scalability,Interpolation; Plates (structural components); Pore pressure; Rasterization; Scalability; Structure (composition); Vector spaces; Vectors; Hybrid vectors; Image magnification; Real time; Real time vector; Reconstruction error; Representation method; State-of-the-art methods; Temporal consistency; Color image processing,"Yao, C.-Y.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering and Taiwan Building Technology Center, Taiwan; 電子郵件: cyuan.yao@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077803051

Because the long-term monitoring is limited by the delayed detection of mood disorder, an accurate and one-time diagnosis is desirable to avoid delay in appropriate treatment due to misdiagnosis. In this paper, an elicitation-based approach is proposed for realizing a one-time diagnosis by using responses elicited from patients by having them watch six emotion-eliciting videos. After watching each video clip, the conversations, including patient facial expressions and speech responses, between the participant and the clinician conducting the interview were recorded. Next, the hierarchical spectral clustering algorithm was employed to adapt the facial expression and speech response features by using the extended Cohn-Kanade and eNTERFACE databases. A denoizing autoencoder was further applied to extract the bottleneck features of the adapted data. Then, the facial and speech bottleneck features were input into support vector machines to obtain speech emotion profiles (EPs) and the modulation spectrum (MS) of the facial action unit sequence for each elicited response. Finally, a cell-coupled long short-term memory (LSTM) network with an L-skip fusion mechanism was proposed to model the temporal information of all elicited responses and to loosely fuse the EPs and the MS for conducting mood disorder detection. The experimental results revealed that the cell-coupled LSTM with the L-skip fusion mechanism has promising advantages and efficacy for mood disorder detection. ? 2012 IEEE.",Cell-coupled LSTM; denoizing autoencoder (DAE); L-skip multimodal fusion; mood disorder detection,"Brain; Cells; Clustering algorithms; Cytology; Diagnosis; Support vector machines; Audio-visual features; Auto encoders; Long term monitoring; Modulation spectrum; Mood disorders; Multi-modal fusion; Spectral clustering algorithms; Temporal information; Long short-term memory; adult; algorithm; bipolar disorder; emotion; facial expression; female; human; long term memory; male; mood disorder; psychology; short term memory; signal processing; speech; support vector machine; videorecording; Adult; Algorithms; Bipolar Disorder; Emotions; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Male; Memory, Long-Term; Memory, Short-Term; Mood Disorders; Neural Networks, Computer; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Speech; Support Vector Machine; Video Recording","Wu, C.-H.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: chunghsienwu@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077667606

First, a new semantic representation of the user's input sentence is presented by using the CKIP parser to derive the semantic dependency sequence of the input sentence. Then, a Gated Recurrent Unit-based Autoencoder is used to obtain the user's turn representation as well as context representation. A Parallel Double Q-learning algorithm with a Deep Neural Network (PD-DQN), combining two Double DQNs in parallel for the contextual and semantic information in the user's message, respectively, are proposed to determine the dialog act. Finally, the user's input and the determined dialog act are fed to an attention-based Transformer model to generate the response template. With the generated response template, the semantic slots are filled with their corresponding values to obtain the final sentence response. This article collects a multi-turn conversation database consisting of 4186 turns in the travel domain and 447 chitchat question-answer pairs as the evaluation corpus. Five-fold cross validation is employed for performance evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed approach based on semantic dependency for intent detection increases the accuracy by 4.3%. For dialog policy decision, the PD-DQN achieves 87.57% task success rate, which is 13.9% higher than the baseline Double DQN (73.67%). Finally, using the attention-based Transformer for response template generation obtains a Bleu score of 13.6, improved by 1.5 compared to the Sequence-to-Sequence model. In subjective evaluation, both the dialog policy and sentence generation model achieve a higher appropriateness and grammatical correctness scores than the baseline system. ? 2014 IEEE.",Attention mechanism; conversational system; deep reinforcement learning; semantic dependency,Decision making; Deep neural networks; Reinforcement learning; Semantics; Syntactics; Attention mechanisms; Context representation; Conversational systems; Q-learning algorithms; Question-answer pairs; Semantic dependency; Semantic representation; Subjective evaluations; Learning algorithms,"Wu, C.-H.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: chunghsienwu@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077190562

To deal with such challenge, caching is considered as an effective way to reduce redundant transmissions. Cooperative caching allows the cache storage to be used more efficiently and increases cache hit rate to further reduce the downloading latency. Recent researches assume that a mobile user can be served by multiple small cell base stations (SBSs) simultaneously, yet this hypothesis requires costly re-design of the infrastructure’s physical layer. In this paper, we propose a backhaul-based cooperative caching scheme which groups several SBSs into a cluster and the SBSs cooperate through wired interfaces. We first formulate a delay minimization problem for cooperative caching, and then propose a greedy algorithm to obtain the content placement with maximum reduced delay. We also explore the impact on end-to-end latency under different simulation parameters, such as cache size and the skewness of the popularity of requested contents. ? 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,Cache memory; Network layers; Cooperative caching; Delay minimization problems; End to end latencies; Greedy algorithms; Physical layers; Recent researches; Simulation parameters; Small cell Networks; Mobile telecommunication systems,"Wang, Y.-T.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: koko0108165@gmail.com",English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063989441

When someone tags the RFID card, the access controller can determine whether to open the door based on the stored user access data (RFID card number and time zone information) in the access controller, and the server can periodically obtain RFID tagging event data from the access controller. However, the access controller cannot store all of the user access data due to the hardware capacity limitation, and the server cannot handle heterogeneous access controllers without knowing their adopted protocols. This study proposes an OM2M IoT middleware framework to mediate the problem. The system architecture consists of a cloud server, server-side middleware, device-side middleware, and devices. The devices and the cloud server use the middleware to convert communication protocol data formats. Accordingly, the cloud server delegates the server-side middleware to handle the new types of devices. Then, to eliminate the shortage of capacity, we enable the cache concept. The access controller acts as the first-layer cache. We need to implement the device application to serve as the cache manager for the device. The devices in the system mean both the access controllers and the associated device application. Then, the device-side middleware acts as the second-layer cache server. The cloud server acts as the top-layer cache server. When each layer of cache encounters a cache miss, it requests data from the next layer. To increase the user response speed by increasing the cache hit rate, we evaluate several cache replacement policies by conducting experiments for various scenarios and implement an experimental result-based policy prediction algorithm in the server to update the best cache replacement policy for the first-layer cache. ? 2019 TRON Forum.",Cache Replacement Policy; Internet of Things (IoT); Middleware; OM2M,Cache memory; Cloud computing; Controllers; Middleware; Access control managements; Cache replacement policy; Capacity limitation; Heterogeneous access; Middleware frameworks; Prediction algorithms; Proprietary protocols; System architectures; Access control,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092170201

Among them, spin-transfer torque magnetoresistive random access memory (STT-MRAM) with SRAM-comparable read speed is a good candidate to build large last-level caches (LLCs). However, STT-MRAM suffers from long write latency and high write energy. To mitigate the impact of asymmetric read/write energy and latency, hybrid cache designs have been proposed to combine the merits of STT-MRAM and SRAM. In such a hybrid SRAM/STT-MRAM LLC, intelligent block placement and migration policies are needed to improve the energy efficiency. Prior studies map write-intensive blocks to SRAM and keep read-intensive blocks in STT-MRAM for reducing the energy consumption of hybrid LLCs. The write-intensive/read-intensive blocks are usually captured by sampling the address (PC) of memory access instructions or adding simple access counters in each cache line. Nevertheless, these prior approaches cannot fully capture the energy-harmful access behavior in STT-MRAM, especially the writes caused by repetitive data transfer between the LLC and upper-level caches. In this paper, we find that conflict misses in L2 often generate thrashing blocks which move back and forth between L2 and LLC. If dirty thrashing blocks that incur extensive writes are placed in STT-MRAM, energy consumption would excessively increase, especially when running memory-bound workloads. Thus, we propose a thrashing aware placement and migration policy (TAP) to tackle the challenge. TAP places dirty thrashing blocks into SRAM and migrates clean thrashing blocks from SRAM to STT-MRAM. Evaluation results show that TAP can provide significant energy savings with minimal performance loss. ? 2019 IEEE.",energy efficiency; hybrid cache; STT-MRAM,Cache memory; Data transfer; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Magnetic recording; Magnetic storage; Static random access storage; Emerging non-volatile memory; Evaluation results; Hybrid caches; Last-level caches; Migration policy; Performance loss; Spin transfer torque; STT-MRAM; MRAM devices,"Lin, I.-C.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: iclin@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077382876

These travel articles include the experience and knowledge of traveler, which can be used as a reference for tourism planning and attraction selection. At present, the most travel experience and knowledge is available in online travel reviews (OTR). OTR and eWOM (electronic word-of-mouth) contain a lot of knowledge of consumers and travelers. Many travelers often look for OTR content through virtual communities, blogs, and search engine, but the search results often cause information overload problems. In addition, through virtual communities, blogs, and search engines, an OTR search still requires using keywords. However, most travelers cannot know the name of the attraction; therefore, travelers cannot use the correct keywords to search. That causes travelers to be unable to get enough information from OTR and unable to make the best travel plan. Therefore, this study focuses on the ontology-based tourist knowledge representation and recommendation method. And the study is to search for popular attractions from the OTR content and construct a tourist knowledge structure for these travelers. When the tourists do not need to know the keywords of the popular attraction name, they just need to get their current location; and then ORT content will recommend the next attraction to the traveler, which helps the traveler make the correct travel decision. The evaluation result showed that the method proposed in this study can help the travelers to quickly make the travel decision and is better than the traditional searching methods. ? 2019 by the authors.",Electronic word of mouth (eWOM); Knowledge management; Online travel reviews (OTR); Ontology; Travel recommendation,,"Pai, M.-Y.; General Research Service Center, Taiwan; 電子郵件: mypai@g4e.npust.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076116776

An efficient system minimizes inefficiencies caused by workpieces failing to meet customer needs and delays caused by slow workpiece inspection. In this study, a workpiece inspection system for measuring path planning is proposed that uses the given coordinate of inspection points discerned from 3D images. Then, an adaptive-group-based differential evolution (AGDE) algorithm is used to optimize the measuring path. The AGDE algorithm incorporates the grouping concept into conventional differential evolution, and this improves local search ability through referencing the direction of the best solution in each group. By using the proposed method, the shortest non-colliding measuring path is obtained. Moreover, the proposed workpiece inspection system shortens the workpiece inspection time and achieves faster performance than manual measuring path planning under multiple workpiece inspection points. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Differential evolution; Grouping; Measurement; Path planning; Workpiece inspection,Evolutionary algorithms; Inspection; Inspection equipment; Measurement; Optimization; Accuracy and precision; Differential Evolution; Differential evolution algorithms; Grouping; Inspection system; Inspection time; Precision manufacturing; Workpiece; Motion planning,"Lin, C.-J.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: cjlin@ncut.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074844784

Here we studied the implication of germline cancer-associated variants on cancer counselling and therapeutic strategies by germline whole genome and tumor targeted sequencing. Fifty-five gynecological and 104 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients were enrolled. We identified 22 germline pathogenic variants in 16 cancer-associated genes.

About 6% of cancer patients presented the secondary findings of germline variants with non-oncogenic impact, mainly on the cardiovascular system which should be carefully monitored during chemotherapy. CRC patients carrying germline susceptibility variants had better disease-free survival than those without variants. Importantly, in the CRC model, the underlying germline alterations mold the tumor somatic alteration landscape. NOTCH1 mutation was the most common somatic mutation in recurrent CRC, implying a potential therapeutic target in adjuvant setting.

The purpose of this work is to automatically populate an ontology using deep neural networks for updating an ontology with new facts from an input knowledge resource. In this study for automatic ontology population, a bi-LSTM-based term extraction model based on character embedding is proposed to extract the terms from a sentence. The extracted terms are regarded as the concepts of the ontology. Then, a multi-layer perception network is employed to decide the predicates between the pairs of the extracted concepts. The two concepts (one serves as subject and the other as object) along with the predicate form a triple. The number of occurrences of the dependency relations between the concepts and the predicates are estimated. The predicates with low occurrence frequency are filtered out to obtain precise triples for ontology population.

To tolerate NBTI and extend the lifetime of the system, previous researchers proposed maintaining all cores in the multi-core system under similar aging conditions (symmetric aging) through various task assignment algorithms and/or dynamic voltage frequency scaling. Although the concept of symmetric aging provides efficient approaches to tolerating NBTI, it may reduce the lifetime of a multi-core system. If a critical task (i.e., a task with tight timing constraints) arrives when the system has already operated for years, it is possible that none of the equivalently aged cores will be able to complete the critical task within its timing constraints. This unavoidable timing failure then will shorten the lifetime of the system. In contrast, if a few cores are kept robust, these cores can be used to execute the critical task even if all the other cores are aged (asymmetric aging), which avoids timing failure and extends the system lifetime. Based on the above observation, this paper proposes a novel reliability improvement framework that consists of task graph Retiming, task Ordering, task Assignment under asymmetric aging, and Dynamic voltage selection (ROAD) for multi-core systems. With our framework, asymmetric aging can extend the system lifetime through successfully executing critical tasks at the later life stages of the system. The experimental results show that our approach can significantly increase the system lifetime with no or insignificant energy overhead. ? 2019 IEEE.",,Dynamic frequency scaling; Negative bias temperature instability; Roads and streets; Voltage scaling; Asymmetric aging; Dynamic voltage frequency scaling; Energy overheads; Multi-core systems; Performance degradation; Reliability improvement; System lifetimes; Timing constraints; Computer aided design,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077802278

The significance of the paper's work is that it relates the notions of h-extra node-connectivity and h-extra conditional fault-diagnosability, so that a regular network's h-extra conditional fault-diagnosability may be known once its h-extra node-connectivity is known. ? 2019 IEEE.",Extra conditional fault-diagnosability; extra node-connectivity; fault diagnosis; general regular graphs; PMC model,Computer science; Electronic mail; Failure analysis; Program diagnostics; Program processors; Computational model; Fault diagnosability; Hyper-cubes; Node connectivity; PMC model; Regular graphs; Graph theory,"Chen, R.; Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, China; 電子郵件: riqing.chen@fafu.edu.cn",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028924777

Constructing ISTs has applications on fault-tolerant broadcasting and secure message distribution in reliable communication networks. Since Cayley graphs have been used extensively to design the topologies of interconnection networks, construction of ISTs on Cayley graphs is significative. It is well-known that star networks Sn and bubble-sort network Bn are two of the most attractive subclasses of Cayley graphs. Although it has been dealt with about two decades for the construction of ISTs on Sn (which has been pointed out that there is a flaw and has been corrected recently), so far the problem of constructing ISTs on Bn is not dealt with yet. In this paper, we present an algorithm to construct n- 1 ISTs of Bn. Moreover, we show that our algorithm has amortized efficiency for multiple trees construction. In particular, every vertex can determine its parent in each spanning tree in a constant amortized time.

These applications depend on a high capacity, reliable memory architecture. To achieve these two goals, hybrid memory that uses both DRAM and nonvolatile memory (NVM) provides benefits that include large capacity and nonvolatility. However, NVM is usually accompanied by high write latency and endurance problems. It is important to reduce NVM writes and improve the latency and lifetime of hybrid memory. One way to reduce NVM writes is to reduce dead pages that occupy DRAM and have not been accessed for a long time. When dead pages are removed from the memory, more space can be reserved for frequently accessed data, reducing DRAM misses and NVM writes. Currently, there are several dead block prediction techniques that can identify dead blocks and reduce miss rates at the cache level. However, they are not effective at the memory level because CPU memory accesses exhibit less locality when accesses are filtered by caches. To propose an application that is suitable at the memory level and to achieve a reduction in NVM writes, this paper proposes a simple but effective dead page predictor, called the infection-based dead page predictor (IDP), for the memory level. IDP uses the access counts of evicted pages to determine if nearby pages are also dead pages (i.e., other pages are infected by evicted pages). The simulation results show that compared to related work, the proposed predictor significantly reduces DRAM misses and enhances lifetime. ? 1993-2012 IEEE.",Dead page prediction; DRAM; endurance; hybrid memory; infection-based dead page prediction (IDP); latency; lifetime; nonvolatile memory (NVM),Durability; Dynamic random access storage; Forecasting; Memory architecture; Nonvolatile storage; Hybrid memory; infection-based dead page prediction (IDP); latency; lifetime; Non-volatile memory; Cache memory,"Lin, I.-C.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: iclin@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077712746

The idea of the HCADIS is to mix intermediate data from a deep network and a feature engineering method call Hough circle transform for utilizing advantages of both methods in inspecting beans. The Hough circle transform is adopted because it performs quite stable and bean shapes are highly close to circles in nature. A set of core mechanisms are designed for collaboration between the deep network and the Hough circle transform for precisely and accurately inspecting defective beans. Finally, we implement a prototype of the HCADIS and conduct experiments for testing the proposed scheme.

In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based defective bean inspection scheme (DL-DBIS), together with a GAN (generative-adversarial network)-structured automated labeled data augmentation method (GALDAM) for enhancing the proposed scheme, so that the automation degree of bean removal with robotic arms can be further improved for coffee industries. The proposed scheme is aimed at providing an effective model to a deep-learning-based object detection module for accurately identifying defects among dense beans. The proposed GALDAM can be used to greatly reduce labor costs, since the data labeling is the most labor-intensive work in this sort of solutions. Our proposed scheme brings two main impacts to intelligent agriculture. First, our proposed scheme is can be easily adopted by industries as human effort in labeling coffee beans are minimized. The users can easily customize their own defective bean model without spending a great amount of time on labeling small and dense objects. Second, our scheme can inspect all classes of defective beans categorized by the SCAA (Specialty Coffee Association of America) at the same time and can be easily extended if more classes of defective beans are added. These two advantages increase the degree of automation in the coffee industry. The prototype of the proposed scheme was developed for studying integrated tests.

The proposed EFI-CNNs were verified by way of face classification of age and gender. The trained CNNs’ outputs were set as inputs of a fuzzy integral. The classification results were operated using either Sugeno or Choquet output rules. The conventional fuzzy density values of the fuzzy integral were decided by heuristic experiments. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) was used to adaptively find optimal fuzzy density values.

Sequence analysis revealed that this protein is unique to Entamoeba species, and it exclusively clusters with a homolog, EHI_099780, which is similarly lineage specific. Both proteins possess an N-terminal signal peptide sequence as well as multiple repeats that contain dyad hydrophobic periodicities. Data from immunofluorescence assay of trophozoites expressing the respective candidates showed the absence of colocalization with mitosomal marker, and interestingly demonstrated partial colocalization with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins instead. Integration to organellar membrane was supported by carbonate fractionation assay and immunoelectron microscopy.

Our aim is to extract the brushstrokes from a painting and generate the individual corresponding relief proxies rather than recovering the exact depth map from the painting, which is a tricky computer vision problem, requiring assumptions that are rarely satisfied. The relief proxies of brushstrokes are then combined together to form a 2.5D high-relief model. To extract brushstrokes from 2D paintings, we apply layer decomposition and stroke segmentation by imposing boundary constraints. The segmented brushstrokes preserve the style of the input painting. By inflation and a displacement map of each brushstroke, the features of brushstrokes are preserved by the resultant high-relief model of the painting. We demonstrate that our approach is able to produce convincing high-reliefs from a variety of paintings(with humans, animals, flowers, etc.). As a secondary application, we show how our brushstroke extraction algorithm could be used for image editing.

Internet of Things (IoT) services in various fields require different types of network service features, such as mobility, security, bandwidth, latency, reliability and control strategies. In order to solve the complex requirements and provide customized services, a new network architecture is needed. To change the traditional control mode used in the traditional network architecture, the Software Defined Network (SDN) is proposed. First, SDN divides the network into the Control Plane and Data Plane and then delegates the network management authority to the controller of the control layer. This allows centralized control of connections of a large number of devices. Second, SDN can help realizing the network slicing in the aspect of network layer. With the network slicing technology proposed by 5G, it can cut the 5G network out of multiple virtual networks and each virtual network is to support the needs of diverse users. In this work, we design and develop a network slicing framework. The contributions of this article are two folds. First, through SDN technology, we develop to provide the corresponding end-to-end (E2E) network slicing for IoT applications with different requirements. Second, we develop a dynamic network slice resource scheduling and management method based on SDN to meet the services' requirements with time-varying characteristics. This is usually observed in streaming and services with bursty traffic. A prototyping system is completed. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated by using an electronic fence application as a use case. ? 2019 IEEE.",5G; Internet of Things (IoT); Network Slicing; SDN monitoring; service quality; Software Defined Networking (SDN),5G mobile communication systems; Information management; Intelligent computing; Internet of things; Memory architecture; Network layers; Quality of service; Scheduling; Internet of Things (IOT); Network slicing; Resource management; Resource-scheduling; Service Quality; Software defined networking (SDN); Time-varying characteristics; Wireless communication technology; Network architecture,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074204624

This popular technology makes people live more conveniently and industry more efficiently. However, due to the ease of the use of WSN, wireless sensor for daily applications are usually deployed in an intuitive plan without a complete consideration. Hence, sensor node captured attack easily intrudes WSN and a novel authentication information exchange scheme in WSN was proposed. Our previous research can solve node captured attack without replacing a completely new authentication but just add our previous scheme in a previous authentication schemes. However, we find some details of this novel scheme are not well designed. We want to discuss possible performance problem in that scheme and provide a complete analysis and discussion on it. The performance issues are including of the design of communication period, the evaluation of security risk and the methodology of control agency scheme. After our analysis, we provide a good design of solving these performance for authentication information exchange scheme in WSN. It can make our previous scheme become more practical and feasible in the future world. ? 2019 IEEE.",performance analysis; user authentication; wireless sensor networks,Information dissemination; Intelligent computing; Sensor nodes; Wireless sensor networks; Authentication information; Authentication scheme; Performance analysis; Performance issues; Performance problems; Security risks; User authentication; Wireless sensor; Authentication,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074202243

This is further reinforced by using supervised deep learning in robotic arm. However, to properly train deep networks and prevent overfitting, massive datasets of labelled samples must be available. Creating such datasets by human labelling is an exhaustive task since most objects can be grasped at multiple points and in several orientations. Accordingly, this work employs a self-supervised learning technique in which the training dataset is labelled by the robot itself. Above all, we propose a cascaded network that reduces the time of the grasping task by eliminating ungraspable samples from the inference process. In addition to grasping task which performs pose estimation, we enlarge the network to perform an auxiliary task, object classification in which data labelling can be done easily by human. Notably, our network is capable of estimating 18 grasping poses and classifying 4 objects simultaneously. The experimental results show that the proposed network achieves an accuracy of 94.8% in estimating the grasping pose and 100% in classifying the object category, in 0.65 seconds. ? 2019 IEEE.",,Neural networks; Object recognition; Robotic arms; Robotics; Supervised learning; Cascaded networks; Convolutional neural network; Inference process; Learning approach; Massive data sets; Object categories; Object classification; Perception-based; Deep neural networks,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072980727

In the former, a template matching algorithm is processed into an Nvidia Jetson TX2 developer kit to detect objects. And, then, control a robot arm to grasp and place. Although embedded systems have some preferred benefits, such as: cost, weight, size and power consumption; the slow processing speed is a significant drawback. To deal with this problem, we propose methods to reduce the number of calculations on the measurement of similarity. After testing on 40 templates with 200 test images, the result shows that the average of execution time is up to 10x faster than the original. The average execution time on middle size templates, (100 \sim 200) \times (100 \sim 200) pixels, obtains 0.176sec.

For example, the discovery of STFs can possibly figure out the phenomenon of virus variation during the epidemic outbreak, further providing the government with clues for the epidemic control. Therefore, we develop a union-based mining with the downward-closure structure to speed up the spatial-temporal mining process and dynamically compute fluctuating patterns.

Appropriate markers for early diagnosis, monitoring of disease progression, and prediction of postsurgical outcome are still lacking. As the majority of circulating N-glycoproteins are originated from the hepatobiliary system, we sought to explore new markers by assessing the dynamics of N-glycoproteome in plasma samples from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), or combined HCC and CCA (cHCC-CCA). Using a mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic approach, we found that 57 of 5358 identified plasma proteins were differentially expressed in hepatobiliary cancers. The levels of four essential proteins, including complement C3 and apolipoprotein C-III in HCC, galectin-3-binding protein in CCA, and 72 kDa inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase in cHCC-CCA, were highly correlated with tumor stage, tumor grade, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival. Postproteomic site-specific N-glycan analyses showed that human complement C3 bears high-mannose and hybrid glycoforms rather than complex glycoforms at Asn85. The abundance of complement C3 with mannose-5 or mannose-6 glycoform at Asn85 was associated with HCC tumor grade. Furthermore, stepwise Cox regression analyses revealed that HCC patients with a hybrid glycoform at Asn85 of complement C3 had a lower postsurgery tumor recurrence rate or mortality rate than those with a low amount of complement C3 protein. In conclusion, our data show that particular plasma N-glycoproteins with specific N-glycan compositions could be potential noninvasive markers to evaluate oncological status and prognosis of hepatobiliary cancers. ? 2019 The Authors.

In this paper, we propose the location-aware acquaintance inference (LAI) problem, which aims at finding the acquaintances for any given query individual based on solely people’s local geographical activities, such as geo-tagged posts in Instagram and meeting events in Meetup, within a targeted geo-spatial area. We propose to leverage the concept of active learning to tackle the LAI problem. We develop a novel semi-supervised model, active learning-enhanced random walk (ARW), which imposes the idea of active learning into the technique of random walk with restart (RWR) in an activity graph. Specifically, we devise a series of candidate selection strategies to select unlabeled individuals for labeling and perform the different graph refinement mechanisms that reflect the labeling feedback to guide the RWR random surfer. Experiments conducted on Instagram and Meetup datasets exhibit the promising performance, compared with a set of state-of-the-art methods. With a series of empirical settings, ARW is demonstrated to derive satisfying results of acquaintance inference in different real scenarios. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Acquaintance inference; Active learning; Check-in data; Location-based social network,Location; Random processes; Acquaintance inference; Active Learning; Candidate selection; Check-in; Location-based social networks; Random walk with restart; Refinement mechanisms; State-of-the-art methods; Semi-supervised learning,"Chuang, K.-T.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: ktchuang@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046466197

The IMU used in our work consists of a three-axis accelerometer and a three-axis gyroscope, which can record information of acceleration and rotation, respectively. Since intrinsic bias and random noise usually cause unreliable IMU signals, filtering methods are utilized to reduce high-or low-frequency noises of the signals. In addition, to more accurately detect whether the smartphone is moving or not, we extract multiple features from IMU signals and train a movement detection model based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Then, a 'reset switch' mechanism is applied when the smartphone is detected as in a static state. The 'reset switch' mechanism can effectively restrain the accumulated error of displacement calculation. Finally, the trajectory reconstruction results are applied to handwritten letter recognition for English alphabet, and the experimental results show that our proposed trajectory reconstruction method is reliable. ? 2017 IEEE.",complementary filter; convolutional neural network; handwritten letter recognition; Inertial measurement unit; inertial sensor; linear discriminant analysis; trajectory reconstruction,Character recognition; Costs; Discriminant analysis; Feature extraction; Neural networks; Smartphones; Trajectories; Complementary filters; Convolutional neural network; Handwriting recognition; Inertial measurement unit; Inertial sensor; Letter recognition; Linear discriminant analysis; Reconstruction algorithms; Sensitivity; Trajectory reconstruction; Image reconstruction,"Hu, M.-C.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: anita-hu@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082597134

With the advance of wireless transmission technology, more and more enterprises have deployed wireless antennas into their data centers. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the state-of-the-art solutions consider radio interference and resource competition into their model design of consistent network update. In this paper, we first propose a wireless dependency model to formulate radio interference. Based on traffic delivery and resource constraints, we formulate the resource competition problem as an update time minimization problem for ensuring the consistency properties, and then propose a greedy-heuristic scheme to minimize the total update time. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is efficient and outperforms a well-known solution designed for network update in SDN. The simulation results also reveal the importance of resolving resource competition during network update. ? 2019 IEEE.",Consistent network update; Resource competition; Software defined networking; Wireless data center,Distributed computer systems; Software defined networking; Consistency property; Consistent network; Resource competitions; Resource Constraint; Software defined networking (SDN); Time minimization; Wireless data; Wireless transmissions; Radio interference,"Pang, A.-C.; Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia, Taiwan; 電子郵件: acpang@csie.ntu.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070994393

The current identification system usually suffers from complex color variations of the images, resulting in plentiful of false object detection. To overcome the dilemma, we propose a two-stage Mycobacterium tuberculosis identification system, consisting of candidate detection and classification using convolution neural networks (CNNs).

We first compared three different CNNs, including ensemble CNN, single-member CNN, and deep CNN.

The need for continuous monitoring of health conditions inspires us to develop an automatic tongue diagnosis system based on built-in sensors of smartphones. However, tongue images taken by smartphone are quite different in color due to various lighting conditions, and it consequently affects the diagnosis especially when we use the appearance of tongue fur to infer health conditions. In this paper, we captured paired tongue images with and without flash, and the color difference between the paired images is used to estimate the lighting condition based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The color correction matrices for three kinds of common lights (i.e., fluorescent, halogen and incandescent) are pre-trained by using a ColorChecker-based method, and the corresponding pre-trained matrix for the estimated lighting is then applied to eliminate the effect of color distortion. We further use tongue fur detection as an example to discuss the effect of different model parameters and ColorCheckers for training the tongue color correction matrix under different lighting conditions. Finally, in order to demonstrate the potential use of our proposed system, we recruited 246 patients over a period of 2.5 years from a local hospital in Taiwan and examined the correlations between the captured tongue features and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which are important bio-markers for liver diseases. We found that some tongue features have strong correlation with AST or ALT, which suggests the possible use of these tongue features captured on a smartphone to provide an early warning of liver diseases. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Automatic tongue diagnosis framework on smartphone; Lighting condition estimation; Tongue fur; Tongue fur (white fur) detection; Tongue image color correction,"Amino acids; Color; Colorimetry; Lighting; mHealth; Smartphones; Support vector machines; Alanine aminotransferase; Clinical diagnosis; Color distortions; Continuous monitoring; Image color; Lighting conditions; Strong correlation; Tongue fur; Diagnosis; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; halogen; Article; brightness; colorimetry; human; illumination; incandescence; liver disease; major clinical study; mobile application; support vector machine; tongue; western medicine; algorithm; Chinese medicine; color; computer assisted diagnosis; equipment design; image processing; liver disease; pathophysiology; procedures; smartphone; support vector machine; Taiwan; temperature; tongue; Algorithms; Color; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Equipment Design; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lighting; Liver Diseases; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Smartphone; Support Vector Machine; Taiwan; Temperature; Tongue","Tseng, K.-C.; Department of Internal Medicine, Taiwan; 電子郵件: S121387@tzuchi.com.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039948351

Compared to single-level cell (SLC) NAND, which stores 1 bit per cell, multi-level cell (MLC) NAND stores 2 or more bits per cell, enabling higher-capacity and lower-cost SSDs. However, MLC NAND has inferior write performance compared to SLC NAND. A method to improve the write performance is to exploit the performance variability in MLC flash memory by skipping the slow pages (i.e., data writes always served by fast pages). However, excessive page skips cause the free space of the SSD to be consumed quickly, harmful to the SSD performance and lifetime. In this paper, a selective page skip mothed called SSKIP is proposed to improve the MLC write performance while maintaining the target SSD lifetime. According to the performance results, SSKIP can improve the performance by up to 56% by performing page skips. Moreover, it prevents violating the target lifetime warranty due to excessive page skips. ? 2019 Institute of Electronics and Information Engineers (IEIE).",Flash Memory; Lifetime; MLC; Performance; Solid-State Drives,Cells; Cytology; Drives; Flash memory; NAND circuits; Lifetime; Multi level cell (MLC); NAND flash memory; Performance; Performance variability; Single level cells; Solid state drives; Storage systems; Flash-based SSDs,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065878540

In real-life communication, non-verbal sounds within an utterance also play an important role for people to recognize emotion. In current studies, only few emotion recognition systems considered nonverbal sounds, such as laughter, cries or other emotion interjection, which naturally exists in our daily conversation. In this work, both verbal and nonverbal sounds within an utterance were thus considered for emotion recognition of real-life conversations. Firstly, an SVM-based verbal/nonverbal sound detector was developed. A Prosodic Phrase (PPh) auto-tagger was further employed to extract the verbal/nonverbal segments. For each segment, the emotion and sound features were respectively extracted based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and then concatenated to form a CNN-based generic feature vector. Finally, a sequence of CNN-based feature vectors for an entire dialog turn was fed to an attentive long short-term memory (LSTM)-based sequence-to-sequence model to output an emotional sequence as recognition result.

While some works have been done to accelerate the computations required by Linux kernel software, they are either application-specific solutions or tightly coupled with the certain computing platforms and are not able to support the general-purpose in-kernel accelerations using different types of processors. In this article, the general-purpose software framework called Kernel acceleration with OpenCL (KOCL), is proposed to tackle the problem. KOCL exposes a set of the high-level programming interfaces for the Linux kernel module developers to offload compute-intensive tasks on different hardware accelerators without managing and coordinating the platform-specific computing and memory resources. The simplified programming efforts are achieved by the developed platform management and memory models, which provide a systematic means of managing the heterogeneous hardware resources. In addition, the one- and zero-copy data-buffering schemes are offered by KOCL, so that the offloaded tasks deliver high performance on the platforms with different memory architectures. We have developed the prototype system to accelerate the Network-Attached Storage server applications. Significant performance improvements are achieved with the three different types of accelerators, i.e., the multicore processor, the integrated GPU, and the discrete GPU, respectively.

A particular case is the investigation into the off-target effects of N-methylpyrrole-N-methylimidazole polyamides, a naturally inspired class of DNA binders with strong affinity to the minor-groove and sequence specificity, but at < 20 bases, their relatively short motifs also insinuate the possibility of non-unique genomic binding. Binding at non-intended loci potentially lead to the rise of off-target effects, issues that very few approaches are able to address to-date. We here report an analytical method to infer off-target binding, via expression profiling, based on probing the relative impact to various biochemical pathways; we also proposed an accompanying side effect prediction engine for the systematic screening of candidate polyamides. This method marks the first attempt in PI polyamide research to identify elements in biochemical pathways that are sensitive to the treatment of a candidate polyamide as an approach to infer possible off-target effects. Expression changes were then considered to assess possible outward phenotypic changes, manifested as side effects, should the same PI polyamide candidate be administered clinically. We validated some of these effects with a series of animal experiments, and found agreeable corroboration in certain side effects, such as changes in aspartate transaminase levels in ICR and nude mice post-administration. ? 2019 Lin et al.

Materials and Methods An accelerated segmented diffusion imaging sequence was developed and evaluated in 25 patients undergoing multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging examinations of the prostate. A reduced field of view was acquired using an endorectal coil. The number of sampled diffusion weightings, or b-factors, was increased to allow estimation of tissue perfusion based on the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model. Apparent diffusion coefficients measured with the proposed segmented method were compared with those obtained with conventional single-shot echo-planar imaging (EPI). Results Compared with single-shot EPI, the segmented method resulted in faster acquisition with 2-fold improvement in spatial resolution and a greater than 3-fold improvement in geometric fidelity. Apparent diffusion coefficient values measured with the novel sequence demonstrated excellent agreement with those obtained from the conventional scan (R2 = 0.91 for bmax = 500 s/mm2 and R2 = 0.89 for bmax = 1400 s/mm2). The IVIM perfusion fraction was 4.0% ± 2.7% for normal peripheral zone, 6.6% ± 3.6% for normal transition zone, and 4.4% ± 2.9% for suspected tumor lesions. Conclusions The proposed accelerated segmented prostate diffusion imaging sequence achieved improvements in both spatial resolution and geometric fidelity, along with concurrent quantification of IVIM perfusion. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The absence of diagnostic markers of BD can cause misdiagnosis of the disorder as UD on initial presentation. Short-term detection, which could be used in early detection and intervention, is desirable. This study proposed an approach for short-term detection of mood disorders based on elicited speech responses. Speech responses of participants were obtained through interviews by a clinician after participants viewed six emotion-eliciting videos. A domain adaptation method based on a hierarchical spectral clustering algorithm was proposed to adapt a labeled emotion database into a collected unlabeled mood database for alleviating the data bias problem in an emotion space. For modeling the local variation of emotions in each response, a convolutional neural network (CNN) with an attention mechanism was used to generate an emotion profile (EP) of each elicited speech response. Finally, long short-term memory (LSTM) was employed to characterize the temporal evolution of EPs of all six speech responses. Moreover, an attention model was applied to the LSTM network for highlighting pertinent speech responses to improve detection performance instead of treating all responses equally. For evaluation, this study elicited emotional speech data from 15 people with BD, 15 people with UD, and 15 healthy controls. Leave-one-group-out cross-validation was employed for the compiled database and proposed method.

Each component can communicate with all other components, through either wired or wireless connections. In an AMI local area networks, various protocols, such as Zigbee, WiFi, and power-line communication, have the potential to be used in AMI communication. Of these protocols, Zigbee offers self-constructing networks, low costs, and superior safety levels. Zigbee is adopted as the LAN communication protocol because of these advantages in this study. In a LAN, a concentrator may encounter many emergent situations, any of which might cause the concentrator to lose its network connection function. Consequently, additional time is required for network construction, which tends to reduce the reliability of smart grids with LANs of this type. To solve these issues, this paper proposes the fast join process (FJP) and enhanced FJP to shorten the time of Zigbee network construction. The strategy employed in this paper is to let every meter join a specified concentrator. The proposed FJP does not scan unnecessary channels. By simplifying association message exchange, we further propose a new method called the enhanced FJP. By using these methods, not only can message flow be managed easily, but the time of network construction can also be improved. ? 2002-2012 IEEE.",advanced metering infrastructures; beacon free network; fast join process; IEEE 802.15.4; network construction; Smart grids; ZigBee,Carrier transmission on power lines; Concentration (process); Electric power transmission networks; IEEE Standards; Information management; Instruments; Internet protocols; Local area networks; Network protocols; Reliability; Smart meters; Smart power grids; Wi-Fi; Zigbee; Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI); IEEE 802.15.4; Meter data management; Network construction; Power line communications; Self-constructing networks; Smart grid; Wireless connection; Advanced metering infrastructures,"Hsieh, S.-Y.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, No. 1 University Road, Taiwan; 電子郵件: hsiehsy@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048643863

The main theme of these problems is to route the services via a subset of hubs, rather than route each service with direct links between demand nodes. Therefore, solutions for hub location problems typically use sets of hubs to reroute the flow of the services and attempt to reduce the costs of building the service links.

Hence, finding visible data objects is an important operation in these real-world spatial applications.

Given the location of a user and his/her view field, a V2-kNN query finds data object p so that p is the nearest neighbor of and visible to the user, where visible means the data object is (1) not hidden by obstacles and (2) inside the view field of the user.

To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to consider both the effect of obstacles and the restriction of the view field in finding the solutions. To support efficient processing of V2-kNN queries, a grid structure is used to index data objects and obstacles. Pruning heuristics are also designed so that only data objects and obstacles relevant to the final query result are accessed.

While multicore technology has become the norm of modern computers, programming such systems requires the understanding of underlying hardware architecture and hence posts a great challenge for average programmers, who might be professionals in specific domains, but not experts in parallel programming. This paper presents a GUI tool called GPUBlocks that can facilitate parallel programming on multicore computer systems. GPUBlocks is developed based on the OpenBlocks framework, an extendable tool for graphical programming, to construct the GUI-based programming environment for CUDA and OpenCL parallel computing platforms. Programmers simply need to drag-n-drop blocks, fill the fields of the blocks, and connect them according to array or matrix computations that are specified by algorithms. GPUBlocks can then translate block-based code to CUDA or OpenCL programs. Furthermore, a couple of optimization constructs have also been offered for rapid program optimization. Experimental results have shown that the generated CUDA and OpenCL programs can achieve reasonable speedups on GPUs. Consequently, GPUBlocks can be used as a tool for fast prototyping of GPU applications or a platform for educational parallel programming. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",CUDA; GPGPU; GUI; Heterogeneous computing; OpenCL; Programming tool,Computer graphics; Computer hardware; Computer systems programming; Graphical user interfaces; Graphics processing unit; Hardware; Matrix algebra; Parallel processing systems; Parallel programming; Program processors; CUDA; GPGPU; Heterogeneous computing; OpenCL; Programming tools; Multicore programming,"Hwang, Y.-S.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: shin@csie.ntust.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050640736

Thus, the complexity of such systems has been increasing, and the focus of designing has been shifting to exploring the design space with a mixture of processing cores/accelerators and the interconnection networks between the components to optimize the performance and efficiency at the system level. Traditional simulation tools may offer accurate performance estimation at micro architectural level, but it is highly complicated to combine the simulators for various components to perform complex applications, and they fall in short in terms of their capabilities to profiling application workload. Furthermore, the speed of such complex simulation would be unacceptably slow with traditional system-level simulation framework such as SystemC. To solve the problem, we develop a rapid hybrid emulation/simulation framework that allows the user to execute full-blown system and application software and plug in emulators, simulators, and timing models for various components in the prototype system, switching the timing models dynamically with our just-in-time model selection mechanism, and connect the emulated/simulated components with scalable communication channels, so that the framework can be accelerated effectively by a multicore host. Our just-in-time model selection mechanism is capable of detecting and skipping regular program patterns to save the simulation time dramatically. In addition, our framework is capable of estimating the performance of different system configurations with concurrent multiple timing models, which further saves the time needed for traversing the design space. Our experimental results have shown that our dynamic model selection and multi-model approach collectively can speed up the design space exploration by 13.4 times on a quad-core host for cache simulation. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Acceleration; Approximate timing model; Design space exploration; Efficient data transfer; Embedded system; Simulation,Acceleration; Application programs; Complex networks; Computer aided software engineering; Data transfer; Dynamics; Embedded systems; Integrated circuit design; Interconnection networks (circuit switching); Just in time production; Learning systems; Software prototyping; Timing circuits; Design space exploration; Dynamic model selections; Heterogeneous computing; Multi-model approaches; Signal processing algorithms; Signal processing systems; Simulation; Timing modeling; Signal processing,"Yeh, C.-W.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: medicinehy@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029901716

To support group communications, each group members have to receive data sent from the group application server (GAS) maintained in ProSe. This paper discusses the use of vehicle-mounted mobile base station to provide group communications over a two-tier heterogeneous architecture with the aid of GAS and ProSe links. In this method, each vehicle-mounted mobile base station (BS) works in a cell breathing manner to expand or shrink the cell coverage periodically. This way can ensure GAS having the up-to-date proximity knowledge of all users while the part of high-cost group data traffic due to the users located far from the BS can be offloaded to low-cost ProSe links instead. We formulate the minimum cost problem of the ProSe-based File Distribution (PFD) in such architecture. We prove the minimum PFD problem is NP-complete and then proposes three sources selection algorithms for PFD, namely Greedy algorithm, Defer algorithm, and Recursive algorithm.

For the M-DCH content concern, DEH interprets M-DEH from the viewpoint of point, line, area and story/site. Point of Interest (POI) is the basic unit of M-DCH and can contain text plus image/pictures, video or audio. A Line of Interest (LOI) is a sequence of POIs in which a visiting sequence of the composed POIs is enforced to have the temporal or spatial view and interpretation of the contained POIs. An Area of Interest (AOI) is a set of POIs in which the composed POIs are related, but the visiting of them can be random. A Story/Site of Interest (SOI) can contain many units, in which each unit can be a POI, a LOI or an AOI, to describe a complete story or a site of culture heritage. For the technical concern, DEH defines a new scenario of the grouping function. A group in DEH is composed of a group creator/leader and some members. In addition to the regular group functions i.e., sharing the content to group members, which belongs to the ""read"" action, defined in common social network, e.g., FB, Line, and WeChat, DEH's grouping function allows the group creator/leader to have the privilege of modifying contents created by group members, which belongs to the ""write"" action. This function is especially needed for content creation and sharing that is instructed/advised/guided in the teacher-student way. A set of metadata elements was defined for POI, LOI, AOI and SOI respectively such that the system can conveniently manipulate the M-DEH contents.

Many existing FPGA-based approaches can achieve a high throughput but cannot accommodate the memory required for large rule tables because on-chip memory in FPGA devices is limited. In this paper, we propose a high-throughput and low-cost pipelined architecture using a new recursive endpoint-cutting (REC) decision tree. In the software environment, REC needs only 5-66% of the memory needed in Efficuts for various rule tables. Since the rule buckets associated with leaf nodes in decision trees consume a large portion of total memory, a bucket compression scheme is also proposed to reduce rule duplication. Based on experimental results on Xilinx Virtex-5/6 FPGA, the block RAM required by REC is much less than the existing FPGA-based approaches. The proposed parallel and pipelined architecture can accommodate various tables of 20 K or more rules, in the FPGA devices containing 1.6 Mb block RAM. By using dual-ported memory, throughput of beyond 100 Gbps for 40-byte packets can be achieved.

The most familiar method to detect ADRs is relying on spontaneous reports. Unfortunately, the low reporting rate of spontaneous reports is a serious limitation of pharmacovigilance. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify a method to detect potential ADRs of drugs automatically using a deep neural network (DNN). Methods: We designed a DNN model that utilizes the chemical, biological, and biomedical information of drugs to detect ADRs. This model aimed to fulfill two main purposes: identifying the potential ADRs of drugs and predicting the possible ADRs of a new drug. For improving the detection performance, we distributed representations of the target drugs in a vector space to capture the drug relationships using the word-embedding approach to process substantial biomedical literature. Moreover, we built a mapping function to address new drugs that do not appear in the dataset. Results: Using the drug information and the ADRs reported up to 2009, we predicted the ADRs of drugs recorded up to 2012. There were 746 drugs and 232 new drugs, which were only recorded in 2012 with 1325 ADRs. The experimental results showed that the overall performance of our model with mean average precision at top-10 achieved is 0.523 and the rea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score achieved is 0.844 for ADR prediction on the dataset. Conclusions: Our model is effective in identifying the potential ADRs of a drug and the possible ADRs of a new drug. Most importantly, it can detect potential ADRs irrespective of whether they have been reported in the past. ?

In this paper, we propose a furniture style compatibility recommendation approach for users to create a harmonic 3D virtual scene based on 2D furniture photos. Most previous works of 3D model style analysis measure the style similarity or compatibility based on predefined geometric features extracted from 3D models. However, “style” is a high-level semantic concept, which is difficult to be described explicitly by hand-crafted geometric features. Moreover, analyzing the style compatibility between two or more furniture belonging to different classes (e.g., table and lamp) is much more challenging since the given furniture may have very distinctive structures or geometric elements. Recently, deep neural network has been claimed to have more powerful ability to mimic the perception of human visual cortex, and therefore we propose to analyze style compatibility between 3D furniture models of different classes based on a Cross-Class Triplet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The convolution neural network that can learn without prior extraction of features fits well in response to the rapid iteration of Android malware. The traditional solution for detecting Android malware requires continuous learning through pre-extracted features to maintain high performance of identifying the malware. In order to reduce the manpower of feature engineering prior to the condition of not to extract pre-selected features, we have developed a coloR-inspired convolutional neuRal networks (CNN)-based AndroiD malware Detection (R2-D2) system. The system can convert the bytecode of classes.dex from Android archive file to rgb color code and store it as a color image with fixed size. The color image is input to the convolutional neural network for automatic feature extraction and training. The data was collected from Jan. 2017 to Aug 2017. During the period of time, we have collected approximately 2 million of benign and malicious Android apps for our experiments with the help from our research partner Leopard Mobile Inc.

The two services include Hadoop data service (HDS) and distributed R language computing service (DRS), which have been built and operated in production systems for 3.5 years. They evolve over time by incrementally accommodating users' requirements. HDS is a web- based distributed big data storage facility. Users simply rely on HDS to access data objects stored in Hadoop with the HTTP protocol. In addition, HDS is scalable and reliable. Moreover, HDS is efficient and effective by intelligently selecting either Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) or database (HBase) for publishing data objects. Specifically, HDS is transparent to existing analytics and data inquiry applications, such as Spark and Hive. While HDS is a unified storage for supporting sequential and random data accesses for big data in the wafer fabrication foundry, DRS is a distributed computing framework for typical R language users. R users employ DRS to enjoy data-parallel computations, effortlessly and seamlessly. Similar to HDS, DRS can be horizontally scaled out. It guarantees the completion of computational jobs even with failures. In particular, it adaptively reallocates computational resources on the fly, minimizing job execution time and maximizing utilization of allocated resources. This paper discusses the design and implementation features for HDS and DRS. It also demonstrates their performance metrics. ? 2018 IEEE.",Big data storage; Hadoop; R language computing platform; Services computing,Application programs; Big data; Distributed computer systems; Distributed database systems; Fabrication; File organization; Foundries; HTTP; Hypertext systems; Silicon wafers; Computing platform; Data storage; Design and implementations; Distributed computing frameworks; Hadoop; Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS); Semiconductor wafer fabrication; Services computing; Digital storage,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062624885

The BT-based mass deployment system can be used to improve performance and scalability that cannot be achieved by the unicasting, broadcasting, and multicasting protocols. However, when the BT-based system is applied in massive deployments, a major issue related to insufficient temporary storage space to store the whole system image before deploying needs to be resolved. Such problems arose because the system is deployed to the disk space, meaning that it cannot be used for temporary storage. Therefore, a novel BT-based solution that can remove the limitations caused by the insufficient temporary storage issue is proposed. The BT-based mass deployment system was designed by using the file system blocks transferring (FSBT) mechanism. The receiver of the FSBT mechanism can obtain the blocks of the file system from other peers. Then, those blocks will be written directly to raw disks or partitions. The sender of the FSBT mechanism can read the blocks of file systems directly from raw disks or partitions. Then, the blocks can be sent to other peers. This approach solves the insufficient temporary storage issue. The novel BT-based mass deployment system was tested and verified for the configuration consisting of at most 32 personal computers (PCs). To demonstrate the achievable performance of the novel BT-based system, comparisons were made between the novel program and the traditional multicast solutions, as well as other solutions for mass deployment. The proposed BT solution can be much faster than the multicast solution when deploying 11 machines or more. The experimental results demonstrated the feasibility and superior performance of the proposed system. Furthermore, performance comparisons of the proposed BT-based mass deployment system versus other solutions demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed solution. In the future, the BT parameters can be further optimized, and the simultaneous read and write features can be implemented to improve the deployment performance. In addition, the BT-based mass deployment system can serve as the basis for the development of other mass deployment systems. ? 2019 by the authors.",Bare-metal provisioning; BitTorrent (BT); File system imaging; Massive deployment; Open source; Peer-to-peer (P2P); System deployment,,"Shiau, S.J.H.; Department of Engineering Science, No.1, University Road, Taiwan; 電子郵件: steven@nchc.org.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059990597

The prediction of ‘worship’ links enables valuable social services, such as viral marketing, popularity estimation, and celebrity recommendation. However, as the concern of business security and personal privacy, only public-accessible statistical social properties, instead of the detailed information of users, can be utilized to predict the ‘worship’ labels. In addition, we observe that friendship properties are not effective to predict the desired links, meaning that most of previous work which rely on the friendship properties cannot be successfully applied in the prediction of worship link. To address these issues, a novel learning framework is devised, including a factor graph with new discovered statistical properties and a Gaussian estimation based learning algorithm with active learning. Our experimental studies on real data, including Instagram, Twitter and DBLP, show that the proposed learning framework can overcome the problem of missing labels and efficiently discover worship links. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Link prediction; Social network; Worship prediction,Learning algorithms; Social networking (online); Active Learning; Business security; Learning frameworks; Link prediction; Personal privacy; Social properties; Statistical properties; Viral marketing; Forecasting,"Chuang, K.-T.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: ktchuang@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046042271

Therefore, in this paper, an efficient haze removal method suitable for hardware design is proposed to obtain high quality fog-free images. Based on the atmosphere scattering model and the dark channel prior method, the atmospheric light of the whole image and the transmission map could be extracted. These are important and necessary parameters of the recovery model. Instead of using single global atmospheric light to restore foggy image, a local atmospheric light estimation method is applied in the proposed design to achieve optimal results. To ensure that the overall image is consistent without block artifacts, dynamic adjustment of local atmospheric light is made based on global atmospheric light. Additionally, to obtain a transmission map, a refined estimation method is performed to ease the halo effect. In terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, the simulation results indicate that the proposed design exhibits superior performance without color oversaturation and distortion. To meet the requirements of real-time applications, a six-stage very-large-scale integration (VLSI) architecture for the proposed algorithm is implemented by using TSMC 0.13-$\mu$ m technology.

We considered two strategies that route data from multiple-source to single-destination. The first one is the severalty strategy in which each data source forwards packets through a route that contains common nodes of other paths as few as possible. The severalty strategy tries to increase the reliability of the route from source to destination and to achieve load balance by Helper-disjoint algorithm. The another strategy is the merged strategy which merges multiple traffic flows passing some specific nodes together. The main purpose of merged strategy tries to reduce the probability of collision while wireless resource are competing to forward data simultaneously and to increase the utilization of DSRC.

We analyzed the trajectories of the above parameters in the survivors and fatal patients in the outbreak in Tainan, 2015. Methods A retrospective study was conducted using data from a tertiary hospital between January and December 2015. Multilevel modeling (MLM) was used to identify the changes in aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and platelet counts from Day 0 to Day 7 of the onset of dengue infection. The machine-learning algorithm was used by purity measure assumption to calculate the accuracy of serum transaminases and coagulation variables to discriminate between the fatal and survival groups. Results There were 4,069 dengue patients, of which 0.9% died in one week after illness onset (i.e., early mortality). Case fatality rate was the highest for those aged ?70 years. Both AST and ALT values of the fatal group were significantly higher than those of the survivor group from Day 3 (AST median, 624 U/L vs. 60 U/L, p &lt; 0.001; ALT median, 116 U/L vs. 29 U/L, p = 0.01) of illness onset and peaked on Day 6 (AST median, 9805 U/L vs. 90 U/L, p &lt; 0.001; ALT median, 1504 U/L vs. 49 U/L, p &lt; 0.001). AST ? 203 U/L, ALT ? 55 U/L, AST2/ALT criteria ?337.35, or AST/platelet count ratio index (APRI) ? 19.18 on Day 3 of dengue infection had a high true positive rate, 90%, 78%, 100%, or 100%, respectively, of early mortality. The platelet counts of the fatal group declined significantly than those of the survivor group since Day 3 of illness onset (median, 19 x103/μl vs. 91 x103/μl, p &lt; 0.01), and aPTT values of the fatal group significantly prolonged longer since Day 5 (median, 68.7 seconds vs. 40.1 seconds, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions AST, ALT, and platelet counts should be monitored closely from Day 0 to Day 3 of dengue infection, and aPTT be followed up on Day 5 of infection to identify the individuals at risk for early mortality. ? 2019 Yeh et al.

The purpose of this study is to generate the follow-up questions which are more related to the meaning beyond the literal content in the user's answer based on the background knowledge in a populated domain ontology. Firstly, a convolutional neural tensor network (CNTN) was applied for selecting a key sentence from the user answer. Secondly, the neural tensor network (NTN) was used to model the relationship between the subjects and objects in the resource description framework (RDF) triple, defined as (subject, predicate, object), in each predicate from the ConceptNet for domain ontology population. The words in the key sentence were then used to retrieve relevant triples from the domain ontology for filling into the slots in the question templates to generate potential follow-up questions. Finally, the CNTN-based sentence matching model was employed to choose the one most related to the answer sentence as the final follow-up question. This study used 5-fold cross-validation for performance evaluation. The experimental results showed the generation performance in the proposed model was higher than the traditional method. The performance of key sentence selection model achieved 81.94%, and the sentence matching model achieved 92.28%. ? 2019 ISCA",CNTN; Dialogue system; Follow-up question generation; Interview coaching; Ontology,,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074727097

When individuals decide to sign up for a tour planned by travel agencies, they often have no idea whether the minimum number of participants will be reached until it is confirmed a few days before the departure, which is of great inconvenience when arranging itineraries. Hence, predicting whether the minimum number of participants in a tour can be reached is closely related to both the tourism industry and the tourists. In this regard, the number of Taiwanese traveling to Japan was predicted based on the popularity of keywords concerning travel in Japan searched on Google Trends. The scores of popular words concerning travel in Japan on the Google search engine and words concerning travel in Japan mentioned in tourism articles in e-news networks were also summarized. The experimental results indicated that the popularity of tourism keywords on Google was highly correlated to the number of Taiwanese tourists traveling to Japan. After the number of Taiwanese traveling to Japan within the following month was classified by the ANN model, the mean square error reached 0.13. Furthermore, by using the data of travel agencies in Taiwan to match the Google Trends data, the research predicted whether tours to Hokkaido would reach the minimum requirement for participants.

To overcome this issue, an innovative methodology that involves an introduced reduced-order equivalent proper regular model (EPRM) of the singular system is presented, to make the tracker-based GARE solvable for a wide class of servo control problems for a singular system.

It adopts MapReduce architecture to divide the whole mining task into several independent subtasks, and takes good use of Spark in-memory computing technology for efficiently processing data in parallel. Moreover, several novel strategies are also proposed for pruning the redundant candidates such that the execution time and memory usage in the mining process are reduced greatly.

Curvature estimation provides a powerful index to evaluate the deformation severity of scoliosis. In current clinical diagnosis, the standard curvature estimation method for assessing the curvature quantitatively is done by measuring the Cobb angle, which is the angle between two lines, drawn perpendicular to the upper endplate of the uppermost vertebra involved and the lower endplate of the lowest vertebra involved. However, manual measurement of spine curvature requires considerable time and effort, along with associated problems such as interobserver and intraobserver variations. In this article, we propose an automatic system for measuring spine curvature using the anterior-posterior (AP) view spinal X-ray images. Due to the characteristic of AP view images, we first reduced the image size and then used horizontal and vertical intensity projection histograms to define the region of interest of the spine which is then cropped for sequential processing. Next, the boundaries of the spine, the central spinal curve line, and the spine foreground are detected by using intensity and gradient information of the region of interest, and a progressive thresholding approach is then employed to detect the locations of the vertebrae. In order to reduce the influences of inconsistent intensity distribution of vertebrae in the spine AP image, we applied the deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches which include the U-Net, the Dense U-Net, and Residual U-Net, to segment the vertebrae. Finally, the segmentation results of the vertebrae are reconstructed into a complete segmented spine image, and the spine curvature is calculated based on the Cobb angle criterion. In the experiments, we showed the results for spine segmentation and spine curvature; the results were then compared to manual measurements by specialists. The segmentation results of the Residual U-Net were superior to the other two convolutional neural networks. The one-way ANOVA test also demonstrated that the three measurements including the manual records of two different physicians and our proposed measured record were not significantly different in terms of spine curvature measurement. Looking forward, the proposed system can be applied in clinical diagnosis to assist doctors for a better understanding of scoliosis severity and for clinical treatments. ? 2019 Ming-Huwi Horng et al.",,"Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Image segmentation; Musculoskeletal system; Curvature estimation; Curvature measurement; Gradient informations; Intensity distribution; Intraobserver variations; Projection histograms; Segmentation results; Sequential processing; Convolutional neural networks; anterior-posterior patterning; Article; cervical vertebra; clinical evaluation; Cobb angle; convolutional neural network; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic test accuracy study; head; hip; histogram; human; image processing; image segmentation; imaging and display; intervertebral disk; lumbar vertebra; machine learning; null hypothesis; physician; quantitative analysis; sensitivity and specificity; sibling; spine; statistical analysis; thoracic vertebra; X ray; artificial neural network; biology; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; mathematical computing; pathology; scoliosis; spine; three dimensional imaging; Computational Biology; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Mathematical Computing; Neural Networks (Computer); Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Scoliosis; Spine","Sun, Y.-N.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: ynsun@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062632775

Wireless fingerprinting based on BLE beacons has emerged as an increasingly popular solution for fine-grained indoor localization. Inspired by the idea of mobility tracking used in the cellular network, this paper proposes a BLE-based tracking system, designated as BTrack, to learn the location area (LA) of an indoor user based on the reported wireless fingerprinting combined with statistical analysis. We propose a new particle Markov chain model to evaluate the LA-level performance regarding the visibility area in an environment with large obstacles. In the presence of sight obstructions, BTrack is evaluated using a real-world test bed built in a library with tall bookshelves. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated in terms of the mean distance error and the LA prediction accuracy considering the direct line-of-sight. Compared with the existing methods, BTrack reduces the average localization error by 25% and improves the average prediction accuracy by more than 16% given a random mobility pattern. ? 2013 IEEE.",beacons; Bluetooth; machine learning; Markov chain; particle filter; People tracking; position accuracy; resampling,Bluetooth; Indoor positioning systems; Learning systems; Location; beacons; Particle filter; People tracking; Position accuracy; Resampling; Markov processes,"Sou, S.-I.; Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: sisou@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060728214

Clouds are very strong optical signals that dominate the results of change detection if they are not removed completely from imagery. As various architectures of deep learning (DL) have been proposed and advanced quickly, their potential in perceptual tasks has been widely accepted and successfully applied to many fields. A comprehensive survey of DL in RS has been reviewed, and the RS community has been suggested to be leading researchers in DL. Based on deep residual learning, semantic image segmentation, and the concept of atrous convolution, we propose a new DL architecture, named CloudNet, with an enhanced capability of feature extraction for classifying cloud and haze from Sentinel-2 imagery, with the intention of supporting automatic change detection in LULC. To ensure the quality of the training dataset, scene classification maps of Taiwan processed by Sen2cor were visually examined and edited, resulting in a total of 12,769 sub-images with a standard size of 224 × 224 pixels, cut from the Sen2cor-corrected images and compiled in a trainset. The data augmentation technique enabled CloudNet to have stable cirrus identification capability without extensive training data. Compared to the traditional method and other DL methods, CloudNet had higher accuracy in cloud and haze classification, as well as better performance in cirrus cloud recognition. CloudNet will be incorporated into the Open Access Satellite Image Service to facilitate change detection by using Sentinel-2 imagery on a regular and automatic basis. ? 2019 by the authors.",Atrous convolution; Change detection; Cloud classification; CloudNet; Deep learning; Deep residual learning; Land use and land cover; Semantic image segmentation; Sentinel-2,Classification (of information); Clouds; Convolution; Feature extraction; Image classification; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Land use; Open access; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Semantics; Change detection; Cloud classification; CloudNet; Deep residual learning; Land use and land cover; Semantic image segmentations; Sentinel-2; Deep learning,"Liu, C.-C.; Global Earth Observation and Data Analysis Center, Taiwan; 電子郵件: ccliu88@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060691480

For devices with more than one network interfaces, the OTT software may need to handover between heterogeneous networks during a call. Unnecessary handover may lead to signal overload, especially in a Wi-Fi intensive area where users may handover frequently between Wi-Fi and cellular networks. For example, if the period between when a user handovers from Wi-Fi to Long Term Evolution (LTE) and when the user handovers from LTE back to Wi-Fi is too short to transmit voice data, the handover procedures between Wi-Fi and LTE can be considered unnecessary and power consuming. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes delay handover mechanism (DHM) to avoid the unnecessary handover procedures by postponing the timing to handover from Wi-Fi to LTE. We then propose an analytical model as well as a simulation model to investigate how many handovers can be reduced. The analytical model is validated against the simulation model. With extensive simulation experiments, the performance evaluation of DHM offers a guideline to configure parameters based on the trade-off between reduced handover ratio and packet loss rate. As a whole, DHM is an application-based mechanism for avoiding unnecessary handovers as well as cutting down LTE usages. ? 2013 IEEE.",Heterogeneous networks; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Over the Top (OTT); Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP); Wi-Fi,Analytical models; Economic and social effects; Heterogeneous networks; Internet protocols; Internet telephony; Voice/data communication systems; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless telecommunication systems; Cellular network; Extensive simulations; Mobile operators; Over the Top (OTT); Packet loss rates; Performance evaluations; Simulation model; Voice over Internet protocol; Long Term Evolution (LTE),"Tsai, M.-H.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: tsaimh@csie.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058100959

This paper proposes an efficient defogging algorithm for both static images and videos. Considering real-time applications, the proposed defogging algorithm involves a low-cost hardware oriented design that is based on an atmospheric scattering model and dark channel prior. Compared with previous low-complexity techniques, simulation results indicated that the proposed design demonstrated superior performance in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluations. A weighting technique and a contour preserving estimation approach are adopted alternately to refine the factors in the defogging process. Furthermore, in the atmospheric light estimation, an adjuster is applied to the video for preventing 'flicker' which means that the brightness changes dramatically between two neighbor frames in the video. Hence, the proposed algorithm is suitable for video defogging applications, which have not been dealt with in previous approaches. To achieve the requirement of real-time applications for both static and dynamic images, an implementation of seven-stage very-large-scale integration architecture for the proposed algorithm is presented. By using TSMC 0.13- mu mathrm m technology, the design yielded a processing rate of approximately 200 Mpixels/s. ? 1991-2012 IEEE.",Flicker-free; real-time application; video defogging; VLSI,Computer hardware; Computer vision; Estimation; Hardware; Heuristic algorithms; Integrated circuit design; Interactive computer systems; Media streaming; Object detection; VLSI circuits; Algorithm design and analysis; Atmospheric model; Real-time application; Streaming media; Video Defogging; VLSI; Real time systems,"Chen, P.-Y.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: hsufy5@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035745545
