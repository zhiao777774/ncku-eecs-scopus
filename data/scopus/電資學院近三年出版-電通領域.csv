To identify a specific device, we usually use the information which attains from network packets such as Internet Protocol (IP) address, Media Access Control (MAC) address and communication port, etc. However, using this kind of information is not enough to identify precisely. Furthermore, most of this kind of information could be imitated easily. Therefore, our research focuses on behavior of communication devices that can identify the devices precisely and create a communication system which is able to imitate the behavior of some specific devices. ? 2021 The Authors.

This paper focuses on a multi-criteria distributed competitive route planning for parking slot cruising in regions where neither real-time nor historical availability of parking slots is accessible. An inference-than-planning framework is proposed for solving the parking slot searching using a zero-information distributed model with an availability inference for parking slots in areas with no sensor coverage. Meanwhile, a proposed Conntrans algorithm is suggested as a two-stage structure with three relaxing policies: adjacent cruising, on-orbital annealing, and orbital transitioning. The evaluation is conducted based on the simulation in a publicly accessible real-world parking data from SFPark in San Francisco; the area is divided into 3 separated regions with different urban characteristics. Overall results show that the proposed availability inference model can retrieve decent performance. Furthermore, Conntrans is able to outperform baselines and state-of-the-arts in overall score by at most 77% with a success rate at around 97% and maintains the quality of solutions under various circumstances. ? 2021 ACM.",Competitive searching; Constrained route planning; Multi-criteria optimization; Parking slot cruising; Spatio-temporal inference,Constrained optimization; Orbits; Competitive searching; Constrained route planning; Multi-criteria; Multi-criteria optimisation; Multi-Criterion; Multi-criterion optimization; Orbitals; Parking slot cruising; Route planning; Spatio-temporal inference; Multiobjective optimization,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119181260

Through machine learning, we are able to capture the potential interactions between urban dynamics and find their mutual interactions in a spatial context. However, despite a plethora of traffic-related studies, few works have explored predicting the impact of congestion. Therefore, this paper focuses on predicting how a car accident leads to traffic congestion, especially the length of time it takes for the congestion to occur. Accordingly, we propose a novel model named Dual-Attention Multi-Scale Graph Convolutional Networks (DAMGNet) to address this issue. In this proposed model, heterogeneous data such as accident information, urban dynamics, and various highway network characteristics are considered and combined. Next, the context encoder encodes the accident data, and the spatial encoder captures the hidden features between multi-scale Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). With our designed dual attention mechanism, the DAMGNet model is able to effectively learn the correlation between features. The evaluations conducted on a real-world dataset prove that our DAMGNet has a significant improvement in RMSE and MAE over other comparative methods. ? 2021 ACM.",Delay Time Prediction; Dual attention; Multi-scale GCN; Traffic accidents,Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Graph neural networks; Highway accidents; Learning systems; Motor transportation; Signal encoding; Traffic congestion; Convolutional networks; Delay Time; Delay time prediction; Dual attention; Multi-scale graph convolutional network; Multi-scales; Time predictions; Traffic-related; Transportation policies; Urban dynamics; Forecasting,"Hsieh, H.-P.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: hphsieh@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119176996

The adaptive stereo matching subsys-tem, which adaptively uses color gradient, color intensity and texture census costs, can reduce the most of computation and achieve good primary depth maps. The recursive re-finement subsystem consists of median filtering, left-right check, hole filling, and bilat-eral filtering functions. The refinement subsystem is performed recursively to reduce the most errors occurred in occlusion regions such that we can obtain high-precision depth maps. Finally, the depth upsizing subsystem by referring original high-resolution images performs depth value upscaling, texture-selected interpolation, and weighted depth vot-ing processes to finally obtain the high-precision and high-resolution depth maps. To evaluate the proposed algorithms in three subsystems, the performances of the proposed stereo matching system are exhibited in step-by-step approaches. In comparison of the existing methods, the accuracy performance and computation time of the proposed stereo matching system are finally demonstrated.

Thus, reducing energy consumption is a critical issue for the success of IoT. Recently, Wake-up Radios (WuRs) play a key role in minimizing the energy consumption by providing wake-up calls to IoT devices which are currently in a low-power sleep mode to conserve energy. On receiving a pre-defined pattern called a Wake-up Token (WuT) over the WuR, the IoT device wakes up in order to process information and/or conduct communications. However, WuR-based IoT devices are susceptible to malicious attacks, such as Denial-of-Sleep attacks designed to drain the device of its energy, or cloning attacks designed to impersonate a legitimate IoT device and perform various nefarious activities. To address these problems, the present study proposes a novel one-time wake-up token using the Physical Unclonable Function (PUF). In addition, to prevent the WuT from becoming desynchronized thereby resulting in a connection loss, a WuT resynchronization scheme is designed to maintain a constant state of synchronization between the WuTs of the gateway and the IoT devices, respectively. Finally, the proposed schemes are extended to support group wake-up and resynchronization procedures, respectively, in order to enhance the communication efficiency and improve the energy conservation. The correctness of the proposed schemes is verified through AUTLOG analysis. It has been shown that the proposed schemes are secure against various types of attacks and consume significantly less energy than existing mechanisms in waking up an IoT device. ? 2021",Denial-of-sleep attack; Group wake-up; Internet of Things; Physically unclonable function; Wake-up radio,Cryptography; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Gateways (computer networks); Network security; Sleep research; Wakes; Critical issues; Denial-of-sleep attack; Energy; Group wake-up; Limited capacity; Physically unclonable functions; Reducing energy consumption; Resynchronization; Wake up; Wake-up radio; Internet of things,"Lin, H.-T.; Department of Electrical Engineering, 1 University Road, Taiwan; 電子郵件: htlin@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113256655

Through this method, the mobile data traffic load over a cellular network is mitigated by offloading some of the traffic to an alternative path; usually a WiFi network. Most previous studies on WiFi offloading have assumed that the data traffic is offloaded to a path with constant bandwidth. However, in real-world applications, it is generally impossible to perform data transmission at a constant rate through WiFi over the entire offloading process, Hence, one of the most challenging issues in analyzing the performance of mobile data offloading is that of evaluating the effects of bandwidth uncertainty on the actual transmission rate. Accordingly, the present study proposes an analytical model for predicting the performance of multipath data offloading over WiFi network with bandwidth uncertainty. The theoretical results are validated by means of numerical simulations. The effectiveness of the proposed model is then further investigated by comparing the QoS metrics of the data offloading process with those obtained in a previous study on mobile data offloading under the assumption of a constant bandwidth. Overall, as the WiFi connection times are highly larger than the WiFi disconnection times, our model removes estimated errors in the baseline model by 8.7% and 6.7% in deadline miss ratio, by 23.2% and 14.9% in average offloading volume, when we consider two and three varying WiFi bandwidth respectively. The results show that the proposed method provides mobile operators with an effective framework for maintaining the QoS level of mobile data offloading in real-world networks characterized by WiFi bandwidth uncertainty. ? 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Bandwidth uncertainty; LTE; MPTCP; Performance modeling; WiFi offloading,Mobile telecommunication systems; Quality of service; Uncertainty analysis; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Bandwidth uncertainty; LTE; Mobile data offloading; MPTCP; Multipath; Performance Modeling; Quality-of-service; Uncertainty; Wi Fi networks; Wi-Fi offloading; Bandwidth,"Sou, S.-I.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: sisou@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111258218

From PHY layer perspective, when an access collision occurs, the access point can still decode the corresponding data successfully if the received signal to interference plus noise ratio is larger than the threshold. This phenomenon is referred to as the capture effect. To improve system throughput, this work proposes a Differential Reception-Power Power Control scheme to take advantage of the capture effect. However, the proposed power control scheme cannot provide a fair transmission environment even though it improves the system throughput. To resolve this problem, this work proposes two methods: the adjustment of contention window size and the modification of probability mass function for the selection of the backoff value. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed schemes can not only remarkably improve system throughput, but also provide a fair transmission environment. ? 2021, The Author(s).",Capture effect; Fairness; IEEE 802.11 WLAN; Transmit power control,IEEE Standards; Signal to noise ratio; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Contention window size; Cross-layer design; IEEE802.11 WLAN; Power control schemes; Probability mass function; Received signals; System throughput; Transmission environment; Power control,"Chih, T.-H.; Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: daz@pcnw3.ee.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100777287

The CLOSE algorithm also selects a group of nodes rather than a single node as a seed for local community expansion, which facilitates the selection of a community suitable for the hub node. We also developed a system by which to identify the most suitable source nodes for given target nodes, referred to as Exploring Local Communities of Target Nodes (ELCTN).

The Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) network is converted into an open and highly interconnected network, where the equipment connections between industrial electronic devices are integrated with a SCADA system through a Modbus protocol. As SCADA and Modbus are easily used for control and monitoring, the interconnection and operational efficiency between systems are highly improved; however, such connectivity inevitably exposes the system to the open network environment. There are many network security threats and vulnerabilities in a SCADA network system. Especially in the era of the Industrial Internet of Things, any security vulnerability of an industrial system may cause serious property losses. Therefore, this paper proposes an encryption and verification mechanism based on the trusted token authentication service and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to prevent attackers from physical attacks.

To motivate the mobile users to transmit data over the cellular/WiFi networks under the control of the operator smartly, many incentive pricing frameworks have been proposed with the execution of dynamic bandwidth reallocation schemes to improve network efficiency. In this paper, a Satisfaction-based Dynamic Bandwidth Reallocation (SDBR) scheme is proposed to improve user satisfaction in term of the blocking probability and the user payment in data offloading environments. In SDBR, the operator can efficiently reallocate the bandwidth to accommodate more potential users; the overall operator revenue therefore increases as well. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SDBR scheme, we first assess the blocking probability with and without serving users having WiFi connections and discuss the benefits of the dynamic bandwidth allocation. Then, we elaborate a satisfaction-based pricing scheme for data downloading to motivate both mobile operator and users to work with SDBR, which brings the increment of operator overall revenue and reduction of individual user payment. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed SDBR scheme outperforms the four existing bandwidth allocation schemes in both time-based and volume-based data transmission. ? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",LTE; MPTCP; Payment; User satisfaction; WiFi offloading,Blocking probability; Costs; Economics; Frequency allocation; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Bandwidth allocation scheme; Dynamic bandwidth; Dynamic bandwidth allocation; Heavy traffic load; Mobile data offloading; Network efficiency; User satisfaction; Wi-Fi connections; Bandwidth,"Sou, S.-I.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: sisou@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85095581538

Up to the recent web application attacks, web injection attacks, penetration attacks, and ransomware that caused a large amount of economic lossesnot long ago have forced computer scientists to pay attention to the prevention of information security incidents. Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs), also known as intrusion detectionand prevention systems, are used for maintaining network security. Their purpose is to reinforce the deficiencies of network firewalls and network intrusion detection systems and strengthen network safety. IPSs can monitor the network status and transmission behavior of network packets inreal time and interrupt, adjust, or isolate abnormal or malicious network packet transmission behaviors in real time.

With these libraries, it achieves a dynamic scalable IPS that can filter out malicious patterns spread all over the packet flow.

In this paper, we propose a dynamical interval strategy for MT6D in IoT systems. According to the attacker behaviors detected by the Intrusion-detection system (IDS), we dynamically adjust the MTD system's changing time interval. The implementation method is based on the concept of finite state machines. The finite state machine of the strategy includes three states, normal state, low-speed scanned state, and high-speed scanned state, respectively.

Thus, we propose an innovative mechanism of the Moving Target Defense (MTD) to solve the problems happening to other MTD mechanisms in the past. This method applies Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to dynamically change the IPv4 address of information equipment in the medical environment. In other words, each of the nodes performs IP-Hopping and effectively avoids malicious attacks. Communication between devices relies on DNS lookup. The mechanism avoids problems such as time synchronization and IP conflict. Also, it greatly reduces the costs of large-scale deployment. All of these problems are encountered by other MTD mechanisms in the past.

In particular, to improve the system performance, we modify the likelihood value calculation of the LDPC decoder with the information of signal-power and noise-power change due to the process of IN reduction and equalizer. ? 2021 IEEE.",Broadband PLC; Error-Correcting-code; Impulse noise; LDPC; Multipath fading,Carrier transmission on power lines; Decoding; Electric power transmission networks; Home networks; Multipath fading; Smart power grids; Broadband power line communication; Electrical grids; Error correcting code; Gigabit homes; Home Networking; Impulse noise suppression; Low-density parity-check; Power line communication system; Smart grid; Systems performance; Impulse noise,"Su, S.-L.; National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan; 電子郵件: ssl@ee.ncku.edu.tw",English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123909241

Our framework changes the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of each host based on specified time intervals, and the scheme does not need to transmit the IP address to the communication parties for notification. The scheme uses the Domain Name System (DNS) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to improve existing MTD schemes, which may have synchronization problems or a single point of failure. Moreover, adding DNS and DHCP into the MTD scheme significantly lowers the cost of deployment compared with deploying MTD devices before each PLC, making it feasible for an enterprise to implement.

However, the demand is usually unmet due to the imbalance of profit. In this paper, we propose a multi-criteria route recommendation framework that considers real-time spatial-temporal predictions and traffic network information, aiming to optimize a taxi driver’s profit when the driver has an advance reservation. Our framework consists of four components. First, we build a grid-based road network graph for modeling traffic network information during the search routes process. Next, we conduct two prediction modules that adopt advanced deep learning techniques to guide a proper search direction in the final planning stage. One module, taxi demand prediction, is used to estimate the pick-up probabilities of passengers in the city. Another one is destination prediction, which can predict the distribution of drop-off probabilities and capture the flow of potential passengers. Finally, we propose our J* (J-star) algorithm, which jointly considers pick-up probabilities, drop-off distribution, road network, distance, and time factors based on the attentive heuristic function. Compared with existing route planning methods, the experimental results on a real-world dataset (NYC taxi datasets) have shown our proposed approach is more effective and robust. Moreover, our designed search scheme in J* can decrease the computing time and make the search process more efficient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on designing a guiding route, which can increase the income of taxi drivers when they have an advance reservation. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Heuristic search; Multi-criteria searching; Spatial-temporal predictions; Taxi service,Data mining; Deep learning; Drops; Forecasting; Heuristic algorithms; Pickups; Probability distributions; Profitability; Recommender systems; Reservation systems; Roads and streets; Taxicabs; Advance reservation; Demand prediction; Heuristic functions; Learning techniques; Planning stages; Search direction; Spatial temporals; Traffic networks; Learning systems,"Hsieh, H.-P.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: hphsieh@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103288409

Current research for passenger flow estimation in transportation route planning focuses on origin-destination matrices (OD) analysis; however, we claim that urban functions and geographical environments around passing area and stations should also be considered because they affect the demand of public transportation.

Apart from this, Tor can reach sites that normal search engine cannot search. As the opinion of Tor, the transmitted data has been encrypted layer by layer, just like onion, before it reaching server.

While considering that CPU, display device, and WakeLocks are the main sources of power consumption that should be managed on Android platforms, this study focuses on managing the power consumption of CPU on smart glasses. The reason is that, based on the features of smart glasses, the much smaller display device and the potentially less misuse of WakeLock do not seem to be the power drains and, therefore, the supplied power is mostly consumed by CPU. The solution developed in this study is presented in the form of a user app (short for application) of power management in order not to directly modify the system internals of Android and to achieve portability. Its implementation takes advantage of the built-in power management mechanism of Android system in order to achieve its functionalities and uses the technique of dynamic messages to assist users in applying, setting up, and saving the desired power plans. The app works by extending the built-in power management functions of the host Android system and imposes no impact on the built-in power governors. For the purpose of enhancing user experience, customized power plans are built as the preset user defined power plans. The settings in these power plans are derived from measuring the real power consumption in common use cases of smart glasses.

With potential vehicle transfers, the ridesharing efficiency can be enhanced. This paper develops a real-time transfer approach based on a centralized pubic taxicab scheduling system. The approach can improve the traffic efficiency by leveraging real-time trajectory information of vehicles maintained in the system. The system can search for a suitable location for the passenger who could be transferred, and calculate the subsequent routes for original and transfer taxicabs. The simulation results based on the road networks of Midtown Manhattan demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed scheme compared to the transfer-disallowed scheme. Several passengers can be transferred to other vehicles to save more travel time and travel distance. Taxicabs on the roads can be used more efficiently. ? 2020 IEEE.",carpooling; multi-hop ridesharing; self-driving; transfer problem,Autonomous vehicles; Efficiency; Travel time; Improving efficiency; Real-time trajectories; Real-time transfer; Road network; Scheduling systems; Self drivings; Traffic efficiency; Travel distance; Taxicabs,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102197645

When dependent tasks are assigned to different developers, there is need for coordination between developers. The needs of coordination are difficult to quantify, however, quantification of the needs of coordination is an important factor to accurately estimate team performance of a sprint.

Although quite a lot of guiding information and helpful resources are available in addition to the official documentation provided by Google, it is not uncommon that the building process failed due to some subtle mistakes and the developer felt frustrated. When system customization is desired, such as tailoring the source code or removing some unnecessary modules from the source code, the burden is even greater because the building rules of Android system lack enough flexibility and Android system has become bigger and.noncomplicated during the past years. It is not only very challenging but also very difficult, if not impossible, to implement the desired tailoring without help from certain analysis tools. This paper presents the development of a GUI based integrated building environment for Android. The main goal is to help smoothly and easily build a custom system image of Android via providing GUIs and integrating the functions needed and desirable in carrying out the building process. The contributions of this work mainly include: (1) an approach to analyzing the module dependency of Android source code that helps remove unnecessary modules or features in customizing AnSroid system image; (2) the GUIs that help users easily and quickly build an Android system image; and (3) an integrated building environment that helps achieve building automation of Android.

In a hybrid network with both traditional network domains and software-defined networking (SDN) domains, the simultaneous inter-domain routing information exchange requires collaboration among different autonomous systems (ASes). However, the rigid routing policies of the conventional BGP are sometimes inadequate to meet the demand of applications with low-latency requirements like augmented reality (AR). In this paper, we propose a Latency Reduction Software-Defined BGP (LRSD-BGP) framework to reduce the latency in inter-domain initial link setup. Furthermore, a controller-to-controller (C2C) communication module is designed to accelerate the routing link establishment procedure of inter-domain traffic by pre-allocating and installing routing paths for the AS in the next hop.

User tracking is one of the key functional elements in millimeter wave (mmWave) communications that heavily rely on directional beamforming to overcome significant path loss. A naive strategy is to track users one by one but this not only introduces great overhead but also reduces the tracking update frequency when the number of users or antennas is large. In addition, user tracking based the angular information, namely angle of arrival (AoA)/angle of departure (AoD) often requires a good initial estimate and an iterative procedure to ensure the accuracy. Aiming to improve the tracking efficiency for multiple users, we propose to track multiple users simultaneously by partitioning users into groups based on the beamspace multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) channel representation. We formulate the joint user grouping and precoding as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINP) problem and propose a low-complexity grouping algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the significant improvement of the proposed multi-user tracking scheme over two existing approaches in terms of the spectral efficiency. ? 2020 IEEE.",,Computational complexity; Efficiency; Integer programming; Iterative methods; Nonlinear programming; Channel representation; Directional beamforming; Functional elements; Millimeter waves (mmwave); Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Multi input and multi outputs; Multi-user scenario; Spectral efficiencies; Millimeter waves,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087273067

Most previous studies on ABE focus on issues such as the revocation mechanism, multi-authority, the access structure design, and traceability. However, very few studies consider the storage efficiency problem and the present study proposes a novel data deduplication scheme based on ciphertext-policy ABE with convergent encryption and block-level data.

Another popular and powerful method with several real-world applications (e.g., energy, finance, marketing, and medical imaging) is fuzzy clustering.

Recently, the leaking of images such as identification and driver's licenses catches much attention. The trend towards secure computation has been widely discussed, especially asymmetric scalar-product-preserving encryption (ASPE) and homomorphic encryption (HE). Although ASPE have ability to encrypt and determine the similarity between ciphertexts efficiently, it is not a practical methodology due to its assumption that the users are fully trusted in real world and it also may have key leakage problem. Contrary to ASPE, HE can execute addition and multiplication in the encrypted domain and solve key leakage problem. Hence, in this paper, we combine the opinions of HE and ASPE to propose new privacy-preserving content-based image retrieval with key confidentiality scheme against the attacks from data owner, cloud server and users. Our privacy preserving image retrieval scheme is developed under strong threat model that is close to real world. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one that developing scheme under the assumption that all the entities involved in privacy-preserving image retrieval system are semi-trusted. Our scheme ensures the confidentiality of key and privacy of query information at the same time. In addition, we provide a lightweight verification to check whether the search query is fake or not. Finally, the experiment results show that the computation overheads and search precision are acceptable at the same time. ? 2013 IEEE.",homomorphic encryption; privacy-preserving computation; Secure image retrieval,Content based retrieval; Cryptography; Digital storage; Storage as a service (STaaS); Trusted computing; Computation overheads; Content based image retrieval; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Image retrieval systems; Privacy preserving; Query information; Secure cloud storages; Secure computation; Search engines,"Liu, C.-G.; Department of Applied Informatics and Multimedia, Taiwan; 電子郵件: chgliu@mail.cnu.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087800750

However, the performance of RFID is critically dependent on the use of effective anti-collision schemes. Hence, many anti-collision schemes are developed for various RFID collision cases. Among the various collision prevention schemes, a promising collision prevention scheme, Pair Resolution Blocking (PRB), can complete two tag identifications in one cycle, which not only solves collision issue but also achieves high efficiency in tag identification process. In conventional RFID systems, PRB is very efficient and crucial. Unfortunately, in a large scale RFID system, PRB seems unable to tackle the massive tag identification jobs in a short time. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the flaws of PRB and firstly propose an algorithm designated as Multiple Identification Blocking Algorithm-Paired Staying tags (MIBA-PS), to improve the bit error rate of the PRB algorithm. The second anti-collision blocking-based algorithm designated as Multiple Identification Blocking Algorithm-Numerous Staying tags (MIBA-NS) is then proposed for improving the efficiency of the RFID tag identification process by identifying multiple tags within a single time frame. Both proposed algorithms employ the collided signal caused by multiple tags to recognize the tags in one cycle. Furthermore, in order to reduce tags’ bit error rate in the wireless channel, the staying tags exploit newly-generated bit string to inform the reader instead of tag ID in the tag identification process. Analytical results and performance evaluation confirm that our proposed anti-collision algorithms have lower error probability, shorter identification delay and lower waiting time than existing famous anti-collision schemes while identifying multiple tags in a large scale RFID system. ? 2020 Old City Publishing, Inc.",Anti-collision; Multiple tag identification; RFID,,"Li, J.-S.; Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: jsli@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081254366

In addition, PSP has been discovered on incremental databases and progressive databases, while NSP mining is only performed on static databases. Progressive sequential pattern mining finds the most up-to-date patterns, which can provide more valuable information. However, the previous progressive sequential pattern mining algorithm contains some redundant process. In this paper, we aim to find NSP on progressive databases. A new definition of NSP is given to discover more meaningful and interesting patterns. We propose an algorithm, Propone, for efficient mining process.

Once this node captured attack occurs, wireless sensor network soon faces various security risks.

Our idea is to add an authentication information exchange scheme in previous authentication scheme but not propose new one.

In this study, HGWN should contact all local sensor nodes and meanwhile is responsible for performing an authentication information exchange scheme for resisting security risk. In order to prevent the attacker from guessing communication period between HGWN and the sensor, we also design a dynamic contacting mechanism. We give a detail discussion of this scheme and validate it by three ways, security evaluation, BAN logic and performance evaluation, which proves that our authentication information exchange scheme can achieve security features and goals. ? 2013 IEEE.",Authentication protocol; IoT; node captured attack; wireless sensor networks,Authentication; Information dissemination; Network security; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Wireless sensor networks; Association schemes; Authentication information; Authentication protocols; Authentication scheme; Critical technologies; node captured attack; Security evaluation; Wireless sensor node; Internet of things,"Liu, C.-G.; Department of Applied Informatics and Multimedia, Taiwan; 電子郵件: chgliu@mail.cnu.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078423180

Proposed system integrated network-based IDS (NIDS) and host-based IDS (HIDS) to detect the suspicious behavior and assess the risk value of each IP. This research is dedicated to separating attacks and suspicious behaviors analysis by network-based IDS and host-based IDS. Furthermore, the proposed system will also find the relations among suspicious IP by using the modified PageRank algorithm and correlate the events to estimate the risk for each IP. The ranking of each IP represent the risk level and network managers can protect the hosts by the ranking. The experiment results show that the proposed system can achieve the goal of managing attack and tracking the suspicious ones. It can help users to take appropriate action in time. &#x00A9; 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",HIDS; NIDS; Risk assessment,Big data; Computer crime; Intelligent computing; Intrusion detection; Managers; Network management; Network security; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Assessment system; HIDS; Integrated networks; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network connection; Network technologies; NIDS; PageRank algorithm; Internet protocols,"Hou, C.-L.; Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: clhou@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065524948

For road driving, the advanced driver assistance system should visually recognize circular prohibition and triangular warning traffic signs to help drivers to grab complete traffic conditions. In this paper, we proposed a low-computation neural assistance system for traffic sign recognition. First, we proposed shaped-based detection algorithms to detect the regions, which are with circle and triangular traffic signs in designated regions of interest. For classification to those detected regions, we then suggest a convolutional neural network to achieve about 5% improvement of top 1 accuracy compared with LeNet model in German traffic sign recognition benchmarks dataset. For real applications, we also establish a Taiwanese traffic sign database to train the proposed neural network. The simulation results on self-collect driving videos demonstrate that the proposed traffic sign recognition system achieved above 97% recognition rate can be effectively adopted in ADAS applications. ?

Especially, the moving object detection (MOD) is an important issue in the ADAS in intelligent vehicles. In realistic systems, there exist two critical challenges including computing time and detection rate for MOD. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel moving object detection system which contains pre-processing, feature extraction, classification and state machine. The pre-processing contains ROI extraction and skipping low busyness windows, which accelerates the computing time to solve the mentioned problem. To improve the performances, in this paper, the weighted histogram of oriented uniform gradient (WHOUG) with support vector machine (SVM) is proposed to promote the detection accuracy. Besides, the finite state machine could further improve the robustness of the proposed system. The results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves better performance than the traditional one, and also maintains real time computation. ?

However, we still face a data redundancy phenomenon in which some of the same feature vectors repeatedly emerged. In this paper, we propose a data compacting approach aimed to reduce the input volume and keep enough representative feature vectors to fit DBSCAN's (Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) criteria. It purges the redundant vectors according to a purging threshold and keeps the primary representatives. Experimental results have shown that the average data reduction ratio is about 81.34%, while the precision has only slightly decreased by 1.6% on average, and the results still have 99.88% of IPs overlapped with the previous system. ? 2019 Association of Computing Machinery.",Big Data; Botnet; Data compacting; Data compression; Data reduction; MapReduce Framework; NetFlow; P2P Botnet,Big data; Botnet; Data Analytics; Data compression; Large dataset; Botnet detections; Data compacting; Density based spatial clustering of applications with noise; Mapreduce frameworks; NetFlows; Pre-processing filtering; Reduction ratios; Redundant vectors; Data reduction,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077338015

Linear HU via variational minimum volume (MV) regularization has recently received considerable attention in the remote sensing and machine learning areas, mainly owing to its robustness against the absence of pure pixels. We put some popular linear HU formulations under a unifying framework, which involves a data-fitting term and an MV-based regularization term, and collectively solve it via a nonconvex optimization. As the former and the latter terms tend, respectively, to expand (reducing the data-fitting errors) and to shrink the simplex enclosing the measured spectra, it is critical to strike a balance between those two terms. To the best of our knowledge, the existing methods find such balance by tuning a regularization parameter manually, which has little value in unsupervised scenarios. In this paper, we aim at selecting the regularization parameter automatically by exploiting the fact that a too large parameter overshrinks the volume of the simplex defined by the endmembers, making many data points be left outside of the simplex and hence inducing a large data-fitting error, while a sufficiently small parameter yields a large simplex making data-fitting error very small. Roughly speaking, the transition point happens when the simplex still encloses the data cloud but there are data points on all its facets. These observations are systematically formulated to find the transition point that, in turn, yields a good parameter. The competitiveness of the proposed selection criterion is illustrated with simulated and real data. ? 1980-2012 IEEE.",Craig criterion; hyperspectral images (HSIs); nonconvex optimization; spectral unmixing,Data handling; Errors; Parameterization; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Transition flow; Craig criterion; Hyperspectral unmixing; Nonconvex optimization; Observation matrix; Regularization parameters; Regularization terms; Selection criteria; Spectral unmixing; Matrix algebra; machine learning; numerical method; optimization; parameter estimation; pixel; remote sensing; spectral analysis; unsupervised classification; volume,"Zhuang, L.; Instituto de Telecomunicac?es, Portugal; 電子郵件: lina.zhuang@lx.it.pt",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075667290

However, portal areas often appear of different sizes and appearances due to the variations of surrounding components such as the ductule, bile duct, artery, and portal vein. The slim fibrosis expanding from the portal area further increases challenges of the portal area segmentation. A Multi-scale Receptive Field Convolutional Neural Network (MRF-CNN) for the segmentation of the liver portal areas in hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained whole slide images (WSIs) is proposed in this paper. The MRF-CNN adopts the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) with multiple atrous rates and symmetric encoder-decoder with feature concatenation architecture. The atrous rates in ASPP are devised of receptive fields to extract features of meaningful tissue components in parallel in portal areas. Along with the MRF-CNN, a small object sensitive loss function is also proposed to have the network focus on small portal areas and slim fibrosis. The results show that the proposed model achieves Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.87 and sensitivity of 0.92. Compared to recent segmentation researches such as Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), U-Net and SegNet, the proposed network achieves an overall the best IOU and sensitivity performance. Experimental results also show that the designed ASPP block benefits in feature extraction, and the ability of identifying small objects in proposed small object sensitive loss has a significant improvement of the segmentation result comparing to the original cross entropy loss. ? 2011 IEEE.",Convolutional neural network; liver portal area; multi-scale receptive field; segmentation; small object sensitive loss,Convolution; Grading; Liver; Magnetorheological fluids; Neural networks; Convolutional networks; Convolutional neural network; Histological analysis; Receptive fields; Segmentation results; Sensitivity performance; Small objects; Whole slide images; Image segmentation,"Wang, C.-H.; Taiwan Semiconductor Research Institute, Taiwan; 電子郵件: denniswang@narlabs.org.tw",English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074830018

However, in many application, the events may span over multiple time points and the relations among events are also important. Time interval-based pattern mining is proposed to mine the interesting patterns of events that span over some time periods and also by considering the relations among events. Previous works of time interval-based pattern mining focused on the relations between events without considering the duration of each event. However, the same event with different time duration may cause different results. In this work, we propose two algorithms, SARA and SARS, for mining frequent time interval-based events with duration, TIED, patterns. TIED patterns not only keep the relations between two events but also reveal the time periods when each event happens and ends. For the performance evaluation, we propose a naive algorithm and modify a previous algorithm along with the implementation of SARA and SARS. The experimental results show that SARA and SARS are more efficient in terms of execution time and memory usage than other two algorithms. Moreover, we extend this work by considering utility value or importance of event in each time stamp. Therefore, we propose another new High Utility Time Interval-based Events with Duration, HU-TIED, pattern. HU-TIED incorporates the concept of utility pattern mining and TIED pattern mining. We design an algorithm, LMSpan, to mine top-K HU-TIED patterns. For the performance evaluation, we design a baseline algorithm, GenerateNCheck to compare with LMSpan. LMSpan takes less time and memory and generates less candidates than GenerateNCheck. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Data mining; High utility time interval-based events pattern mining; Temporal pattern mining; Time interval-based events with duration pattern mining,Information systems; Duration patterns; Frequent sequential patterns; Memory usage; Pattern mining; Temporal pattern minings; Time duration; Time interval; Utility values; Data mining,"Jaysawal, B.P.; Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: bijay@jaysawal.com.np",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073686775

Expanding of a source node into a community is one of the most successful methods for local community detection, especially when the global structure of the network is not accessible. In this paper, we propose CLOSE algorithm, Local Community Detection by LOcal Structure Expansion, based on the local expansion technique in the community detection. In CLOSE, we propose a novel connective function to identify a better source node. The node is in the center of a highly connected component of a graph. CLOSE selects a group of nodes instead of a single node to be the seed for the expansion of a local community. In addition, using the neighboring group can identify a suitable community for a hub node. Moreover, the expansion strategy is based on the label propagation technique instead of local community measurements. In experiments, we compare the performance of CLOSE with previous methods both on synthetic networks from the LFR Benchmark and real-world networks. We also examine the merit of the source node selection strategy. Both source node selection and community detection in CLOSE outperform previous algorithms. ? 2019 IEEE.",complex networks; local community detection; neighboring group expansion; source node selection,Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Population dynamics; Community detection; Community discoveries; Connected component; Expansion strategies; Local community; Real-world networks; Source nodes; Synthetic networks; Complex networks,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079074532

Recently, an enhanced super-resolution based on generative adversarial network (ESRGAN) has achieved excellent performance in terms of both qualitative and quantitative quality of the reconstructed high-resolution image. In this paper, we propose to add one more shortcut between two dense-blocks, as well as add shortcut between two convolution layers inside a dense-block. With this simple strategy of adding more shortcuts in the proposed network, it enables a faster learning process as the gradient information can be back-propagated more easily. Based on the improved ESRGAN, the dual reconstruction is proposed to learn different aspects of the super-resolved image for judiciously enhancing the quality of the reconstructed image. In practice, the super-resolution model is pre-trained solely based on pixel distance, followed by fine-tuning the parameters in the model based on adversarial loss and perceptual loss. Finally, we fuse two different models by weighted-summing their parameters to obtain the final super-resolution model. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method achieves excellent performance in the real-world image super-resolution challenge.

The solutions obtained are simulated with a well-known microscopic traffic simulator named Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). Experiments were carried out based on data from Kaohsiung, Taiwan, Bahia Blanca, Argentina, and Ma laga, Spain that represent different experimental cases to evaluate the performance of GWGHA. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art search algorithms compared in this paper for solving the CTLP. ? 2019 IEEE.",,Timing circuits; Traffic signs; Vehicle actuated signals; Vehicles; Hybrid metaheuristic algorithms; Number of vehicles; Optimization algorithms; Optimization problems; Quality of solution; Timing optimization; Traffic simulators; Traffic situations; Optimization,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076746032

During the tree search process, we calculate the soft value of each visited node based on the path from the root to this node. The expansion range of each visited node is determined by the soft value and a branch list. With the soft values, we can reduce the ranges of nodes to be searched while maintaining the performance of near-ML detection. For a given branch list, we also give an upper bound of the total number of visited nodes. The channel inversion or channel sorting preprocessing is not necessary. We also consider an improved scheme with the dynamic branch list.

The main challenge in such multicell systems is the co-channel interference, including intra-user interference (IUI) and inter-cell interference (ICI). To deal with both IUI and ICI, most conventional schemes aim to maximize the signal to interference plus noise ratio or throughputs through enormous channel state information (CSI) exchange among base stations. In order to avoid such tremendous overhead, this work proposes a novel framework, containing a distributed subcarrier assignment and a block diagonalization (BD) precoding, to cope with both types of interferences based on limited exchanged information of subcarrier-assignment and local CSIs (channel gains). In the subcarrier-assignment process, each sector’s base station independently assigns a subset of the served UEs to be served over the subcarrier. The channel gains of a particular subcarrier hold a semi-orthogonal property for that subset. Then, on the basis of limited exchanges of information, a BD-type precoding is presented to completely eliminate all IUI and suppress the major part of the leakage interference to the adjacent sectors by exploiting principal component analysis. The simulation results indicate that the proposed framework can provide more QoS-satisfied UEs than that obtained in a previous work. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Cellular network; Interference management; MU-MIMO; Precoding; Principal component analysis; Resource allocation,Base stations; Channel state information; MIMO systems; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Signal interference; Signal to noise ratio; Cellular network; Intercell interference; Interference management; MU-MIMO; Multi user multiple input multiple outputs; Precoding; Resource allocation schemes; Signal to interference plus noise ratio; Principal component analysis,"Chih, T.-H.; Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: daz@pcnw3.ee.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066123822

For a retail store, the common indicator of profit is its popularity which can be measured by the number of people who had ever consumed there. If one can know the potential popularity of locations along the time or within a certain time period (e.g., Christmas holiday or some memorial days) in advance, it would facilitate the determination of locations that are more profitable for the geographical placement of new retail stores. In this paper, given a targeted retail chain as well as some candidate locations, we propose to predict the popularity values of these locations over time to support their decisions on placing new stores.

The main concept of the clustering procedure is to identify and assign data objects into sensible disjointed groups based on similarity measures, such as the Euclidean distance. In this case, data objects within a group are similar to each other with regard to the similarity measure, and each group is dissimilar to each other. Fuzzy clustering is also a popular and powerful research method with many applications, such as medical imaging processing with real words. In the fuzzy clustering research field, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm is one of the most important fuzzy clustering approaches for efficient and easy implementation; however, the FCM algorithm has a weakness in which it can easily become trapped in local optima. Thus, some metaheuristic algorithms, such as genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), can be combined with FCM to solve the clustering problem. Recently, a novel metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the social behavior of humpback whales, called the whale optimization algorithm (WOA), has been proposed. In addition, the WOA has obtained more efficient solutions than some popular metaheuristic algorithms, such as the gene GA and PSO. In this paper, a fuzzy clustering algorithm that called the memetic fuzzy whale optimization (MFWO) algorithm, is proposed to solve the data clustering problem. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using eight real-world UCI benchmarks, and the FCM and fuzzy PSO algorithms are compared. The experimental results show that the proposed MFWO algorithm is more efficient than the compared algorithms. ? 2019 IEEE.",Clustering; Fuzzy C-means; Meta-Heuristic Algorithm; Whale Optimization Algorithm,Benchmarking; Cluster analysis; Computational complexity; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Medical imaging; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Clustering; Clustering approach; Clustering problems; Clustering procedure; Fuzzy C mean; Fuzzy C-means algorithms; Meta heuristic algorithm; Optimization algorithms; Clustering algorithms,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071322039

In this paper, we try to solve this problem from a different strategy-in an improvement perspective. A more complex condition is depicted as both positive and negative opinions are propagating in the social network. The objective function considers the maximization of the positive influence and minimizes the negative opinion spreading simultaneously. We propose IDR (Influence Distribution Redirection) algorithm to define initial seed nodes of influence diffusion based on redirecting the influence distribution of nodes to maximize the objective function. The influence distribution of nodes shows the potential influence trend of nodes during the influence diffusion process. The key strategy is reducing the positive influence nearby the steady nodes and increasing in the vacillate region. From the experimental results, IDR outperforms the compared method on the objective function. In addition, IDR also improves the performance of increasing the number of positive active nodes and decreasing the number of negative activated nodes respectively. ? 2019 IEEE.",Influence Maximization; Positive and Negative Opinions; Social Network Analysis,Backpropagation; Information management; Active node; Complex condition; Diffusion process; Influence maximizations; Linear threshold models; Objective functions; Positive and Negative Opinions; Word of mouth; Social networking (online),,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070944282

IUData List stores information of length-1 itemsets along with their positions in the transactions to efficiently obtain the initial projected database.

However, with the increase of small cells, user equipments (UEs) will experience frequent handovers which not only induce high signaling overhead, but also raise the risk of call-dropping. In addition, the different cell coverages and irregular mobile traffic lead to unbalanced loading in the HetNets. An overloaded cell will suffer from high call-block-rate (CBR) and call-drop-rate (CDR), especially in mobility networks. This work addresses on these problems and proposes a novel handover process to adaptively adjust cell-individual-offset (CIO) based on different average cell loading. Moreover, an access control mechanism is also presented to resolve the resource shortage problem in a congested network.

The proposed algorithm consists of an initial assignment phase and a compensation phase. In the first phase, each subcarrier is assigned to mobile users with higher channel gains and lower mutual co-channel interferences.

This paper discusses the use of vehicle-mounted mobile base station to provide group communications over a two-tier heterogeneous architecture with the aid of GAS and ProSe links. In this method, each vehicle-mounted mobile base station (BS) works in a cell breathing manner to expand or shrink the cell coverage periodically. This way can ensure GAS having the up-to-date proximity knowledge of all users while the part of high-cost group data traffic due to the users located far from the BS can be offloaded to low-cost ProSe links instead.

Existing studies have shown that cooperative communications can significantly reduce total energy consumption within a network. Most of these studies assume that all nodes in the network transmit cooperatively. However, in practical networks, nodes may act selfishly and refuse to participate. Accordingly, this study proposes a novel reputation auction framework based on an indirect reciprocity concept to stimulate node cooperation in green wireless networks and to provide a means to adapt to changing network dynamics. The proposed framework comprises two sealed-bid auction schemes in which node reputations in single- and multiple-relay transmission scenarios, respectively, are allocated in an efficient and fair manner to generate energy savings from application of the indirect reciprocity model. An analytical model is proposed to evaluate the outage probability of the proposed schemes. The results derived using this model agree with those obtained from computer simulations. Also, an adaptive scheme is proposed to combine the advantages of single- and multiple-relay transmission. Simulations show that the proposed framework achieves higher energy efficiency and a lower outage probability than non-cooperative schemes. Furthermore, the adaptive scheme outperforms other schemes in terms of outage probability. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Auction theory; Cooperative networks; Green wireless networks; Outage probability analysis; Reputation,Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Probability; Wireless telecommunication systems; Auction theory; Cooperative networks; Green wireless networks; Outage probability analysis; Reputation; Cooperative communication,"Lin, H.-T.; Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: htlin@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058955803

The main challenge in such multicell systems is the co-channel interference, including intra-user interference (IUI) and inter-cell interference (ICI). To deal with both IUI and ICI, most conventional schemes aim to maximize the signal to interference plus noise ratio or throughputs through enormous channel state information (CSI) exchange among base stations. In order to avoid such tremendous overhead, this work proposes a novel framework, containing a distributed subcarrier assignment and a block diagonalization (BD) precoding, to cope with both types of interferences based on limited exchanged information of subcarrier-assignment and local CSIs (channel gains). In the subcarrier-assignment process, each sector’s base station independently assigns a subset of the served UEs to be served over the subcarrier. The channel gains of a particular subcarrier hold a semi-orthogonal property for that subset. Then, on the basis of limited exchanges of information, a BD-type precoding is presented to completely eliminate all IUI and suppress the major part of the leakage interference to the adjacent sectors by exploiting principal component analysis. The simulation results indicate that the proposed framework can provide more QoS-satisfied UEs than that obtained in a previous work. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Cellular network; Interference management; MU-MIMO; Precoding; Principal component analysis; Resource allocation,Base stations; Channel state information; MIMO systems; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Signal interference; Signal to noise ratio; Cellular network; Intercell interference; Interference management; MU-MIMO; Multi user multiple input multiple outputs; Precoding; Resource allocation schemes; Signal to interference plus noise ratio; Principal component analysis,"Chih, T.-H.; Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: daz@pcnw3.ee.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065966568

In this paper, we first address the problem of canceling the inter-client interference (ICI) from multiple uplink clients to multiple downlink clients in such a scenario. The proposed ICI nulling approach, namely, multiuser ICI cancellation (MU-IC2), enables the AP to actively and completely eliminate the ICI for the downlink clients. With this method, the gain from FD processing can be achieved much efficiently. Design guideline is given and reduced-complexity implementation for use with a large number of antennas at the AP is also derived. Furthermore, in some circumstances, notable residual self-interference (SI) exists at the AP due to the imperfection of SI cancellation during the FD operation. This may enlarge the interference observed by the downlink clients. We provide new ways, i.e., two MU-SI-IC2 approaches, to deal with this case based on the possible knowledge of SI as well. As a result, both the SI-induced interference and ICI are effectively eliminated, and the overall throughput can still be benefited from FD and kept at a high level. The simulation results show that in terms of the network SE, our proposed MU-IC2 and MU-SI-IC2 can significantly outperform some baseline schemes and the state-of-the-art active ICI mitigation methods in various scenarios. ? 2019 IEEE.",Full-duplex; inter-client interference; interference cancellation; large-scale antenna system; self-interference; spectral efficiency,Efficiency; Finite difference method; Antenna system; Full-duplex; Interference cancellation; Self-interferences; Spectral efficiencies; Multiple access interference,"Lee, Y.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: ymlee@ncnu.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061807973

Recently, investigating HU under the non-negligible endmember variability (EV) and outlier effects (OE) has drawn extensive attention. Some state-of-the-art works either consider EV or consider OE, but none of them considers both EV and OE simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel HU algorithm, referred to as the variability/outlier-insensitive multi-convex unmixing (VOIMU) algorithm, which is robust against both EV and OE. Considering two suitable regularizers, a nonconvex minimization problem is formulated for which the perturbed linear mixing model proposed by Thouvenin et al., is used for modeling EV, while OE is implicitly handled by applying a p quasi-norm to the data fitting with 0 < p < 1. Then, we reformulate it into a multi-convex problem which is then solved by the block coordinate descent method, with convergence guarantee by casting it into the block successive upper bound minimization framework. The proposed VOIMU algorithm can yield a stationary-point solution with convergence guarantee, together with some intriguing information of potential outlier pixels though outliers are neither physically modeled in the above problem nor detected in the algorithm operation. Finally, we provide some simulation results and experimental results using real data to demonstrate the efficacy and practical applicability of the proposed VOIMU algorithm. ? 2018 IEEE.",alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM); block coordinate descent (BCD) method; block successive upper bound minimization (BSUM); endmember variability; Hyperspectral imaging; outlier effects,Spectroscopy; Statistics; Alternating direction method of multipliers; Block coordinate descents; Endmember variabilities; Outlier effect; Upper Bound; Hyperspectral imaging,"Chi, C.-Y.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: cychi@ee.nthu.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061785051

However, the large number of users, website services will make itself became the most favorite targets for hackers. Although these malicious behaviors can be detected by network intrusion detection system, it is difficult to generate accuracy result owing to the shortage of data. This paper proposed a solution using host intrusion detection system that focus on the host log detection of webserver. Besides using port monitoring to monitor network environment, this paper also collected signatures of web attack and malicious activities by using signature-based approach. Furthermore, this research will find out the source of the malicious files with file monitoring function, and take appropriate action to protect web services. By using the proposed mechanism of host-based intrusion detection methods, it can provide a high accuracy to bring safety for managers and users. ?

With the rapid development of the internet, IOT (internet of things) makes every massive infrastructure more convenient to be control and monitoring. However, the convenience of remote controlling to the infrastructure may cause serious damage which could affect people’s livelihood. Consequently, an effective and protective mechanism to protect the SCADA system is necessary. We have investigated the related attacks and defensive methods. This paper surveys varying SCADA system and the honeypot system of SCADA. Then we proposed a defensive architecture with honeypot system to protect the SCADA system. ?

Due to the twisted routes of the sub-coils in the proposed inductor, the interference caused by a nearby electromagnetic noise source can be compensated and reduced. By using a 0.18-μm standard CMOS process, the proposed inductor and a conventional single-turn spiral inductor in a similar size are integrated into two respective VCO testchips. The injection pulling behaviors of these two oscillators are studied and compared. The experimental results show that the VCO integrated with the proposed honeycomb-shaped planar inductor can significantly mitigate the injection pulling phenomenon as compared with the VCO integrated with a conventional single-turn inductor in a similar size. In this brief, the enhancement of mitigation over 15 dB can be achieved. ? 2004-2012 IEEE.",CMOS; honeycomb-shaped planar inductor; Injection pulling; VCO; voltage-controlled oscillator,Circuit oscillations; CMOS integrated circuits; Honeycomb structures; Oscillistors; Variable frequency oscillators; Electromagnetic noise; Injection pulling; Planar inductor; Spiral inductor; Standard CMOS process; Two oscillators; Electric inductors,"Huang, T.-H.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: thhuang@ee.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045301836
