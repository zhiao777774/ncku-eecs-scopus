Based on preoperative CT scans, radiomic features were extracted and selected to build pixel image data using covariate-adjusted tensor classification in the high-dimension (CATCH) model. The differentially expressed RNA genes, as radiomic covariates, were identified by cancer recurrence. Predictive models were built using the pixel image and immune genomic expression factors, and the area under the curve (AUC) and F1 score were used to evaluate their performance. Significantly adjusted radiomic features were selected to predict recurrence. The association between the significantly adjusted radiomic features and immune gene expression was also investigated. Overall, 1037 radiomic features were converted into 33 × 32-pixel image data. Thirty differentially expressed genes were identified. We performed 100 iterations of 3-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the CATCH model, which showed a high sensitivity of 0.66 and an F1 score of 0.69. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.56. Overall, ten adjusted radiomic features were significantly associated with cancer recurrence in the CATCH model. All of these methods are texture-associated radiomics. Compared with nonadjusted radiomics, 7 out of 10 adjusted radiomic features influenced recurrence-free survival. The adjusted radiomic features were positively associated with PECAM1, PRDM1, AIF1, IL10, ISG20, and TLR8 expression. We provide individualized cancer therapeutic strategies based on adjusted radiomic features in recurrent stage III CRC. Adjusted CT scan image-based radiomics with immune genomic expression covariates using the CATCH model can efficiently predict cancer recurrence. The correlation between adjusted radiomic features and immune genomic expression can provide biological relevance and individualized therapeutic targets. © 2022 by the authors.

A graph H= (V′, E′) is called a spanning subgraph of G= (V, E) if V′= V and E′⊆ E. Given a positive integer p, let H be a spanning subgraph of G satisfying the three conditions: (i) there exists a vertex subset C⊆ V such that C forms a clique of size p in H; (ii) the set V\ C forms an independent set in H; and (iii) each vertex v∈ V\ C is adjacent to exactly one vertex in C. The vertices in C are called hubs and the vertices in V\ C are called non-hubs. The Δβ- p-Hub Center Problem (Δβ- pHCP) is to find a spanning subgraph H of G satisfying all the three conditions such that the diameter of H is minimized. In this paper, we study Δβ- pHCP for all β≥12. We show that for any ϵ&gt; 0 , to approximate Δβ- pHCP to a ratio g(β) - ϵ is NP-hard and we give r(β) -approximation algorithms for the same problem where g(β) and r(β) are functions of β.

We hypothesized that certain genetic abnormalities were associated with lymphomatous effusions, which would help to identify related pathways, oncogenic mechanisms, and therapeutic targets. Methods: We compared whole-exome sequencing on DLBCL samples involving solid organs (n = 22) and involving effusions (n = 9). We designed a mutational accumulation-based approach to score each gene and used mutation interpreters to identify candidate pathogenic genes associated with lymphomatous effusions. Moreover, we performed gene-set enrichment analysis from a microarray comparison of effusion-associated versus non-effusion-associated DLBCL cases to extract the related pathways. Results: We found that genes involved in identified pathways or with high accumulation scores in the effusion-based DLBCL cases were associated with migration/invasion. We validated expression of 8 selected genes in DLBCL cell lines and clinical samples: MUC4, SLC35G6, TP53BP2, ARAP3, IL13RA1, PDIA4, HDAC1 and MDM2, and validated expression of 3 proteins (MUC4, HDAC1 and MDM2) in an independent cohort of DLBCL cases with (n = 31) and without (n = 20) lymphomatous effusions. We found that overexpression of HDAC1 and MDM2 correlated with the presence of lymphomatous effusions, and HDAC1 overexpression was associated with the poorest prognosis. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that DLBCL associated with lymphomatous effusions may be associated mechanistically with TP53-MDM2 pathway and HDAC-related chromatin remodeling mechanisms. © 2021, The Author(s).",Bioinformatics; Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; HDAC1; Lymphomatous effusions; Prognosis; Sequencing; Whole exome,B lymphocyte receptor; beta actin; breakpoint cluster region protein; cytokine; DNA polymerase; focal adhesion kinase; genomic DNA; glycoprotein; histone deacetylase 1; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; Ki 67 antigen; mannomustine; membrane protein; monoclonal antibody; mouse double minute 2 homolog; mucin 4; mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1; Notch1 receptor; protein; protein bcl 2; protein p53; SUMO protein; synaptophysin; toll like receptor; transcription factor EZH2; vasculotropin; adult; aged; ArfGAP with RhoGAP domain ankyrin repeat And PH domain 3; Article; B cell lymphoma cell; B lymphocyte; bioinformatics; cancer prognosis; cell culture; cell cycle; cell migration; chromatin assembly and disassembly; cohort analysis; controlled study; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; DNA extraction; down regulation; Escherichia coli; female; gene; gene expression; gene library; gene set enrichment analysis; human; illumina sequencing; immunohistochemistry; interleukin 13 receptor subunit alpha 1; JAK-STAT signaling; major clinical study; male; MAPK signaling; microarray analysis; middle aged; mutation; oncogene c myc; organ; pathogenicity; pathology; polymerase chain reaction; primary effusion lymphoma; protein disulfide isomerase family A member 4; quality control; RNA extraction; sequence analysis; signal transduction; solute carrier family 35 member G6; somatic hypermutation; tissues; tumor gene; tumor invasion; tumor protein P53 binding protein 2; validation process; very elderly; Western blotting; whole exome sequencing,"Chiang, J.-H.; Intelligent Information Retrieval Lab, Taiwan; 電子郵件: jchiang@mail.ncku.edu.tw

We used deletion structural variants (DSVs) generated from germline whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and DSV immune-related association tumor microenvironment (TME) to predict cancer risk and prognosis. Methods: We investigated the contribution of germline DSVs to cancer susceptibility and prognosis by silicon and causal inference models. DSVs in germline WGS data were generated from the blood samples of 192 cancer and 499 non-cancer subjects. Clinical information, including family cancer history (FCH), was obtained from the National Cheng Kung University Hospital and Taiwan Biobank. Ninety-nine colorectal cancer (CRC) patients had immune response gene expression data. We used joint calling tools and an attention-weighted model to build the cancer risk predictive model and identify DSVs in familial cancer. The survival support vector machine (survival-SVM) was used to select prognostic DSVs. Results: We identified 671 DSVs that could predict cancer risk. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of the attention-weighted model was 0.71. The 3 most frequent DSV genes observed in cancer patients were identified as ADCY9, AURKAPS1, and RAB3GAP2 (p < 0.05). The DSVs in SGSM2 and LHFPL3 were relevant to colorectal cancer. We found a higher incidence of FCH in cancer patients than in non-cancer subjects (p < 0.05). SMYD3 and NKD2DSV genes were associated with cancer patients with FCH (p < 0.05). We identified 65 immune-associated DSV markers for assessing cancer prognosis (p < 0.05). The functional protein of MUC4 DSV gene interacted with MAGE1 expression, according to the STRING database. The causal inference model showed that deleting the CEP72 DSV gene affect the recurrence-free survival (RFS) of IFIT1 expression. Conclusions: We established an explainable attention-weighted model for cancer risk prediction and used the survival-SVM for prognostic stratification by using germline DSVs and immune gene expression datasets. Comprehensive assessments of germline DSVs can predict the cancer risk and clinical outcome of colon cancer patients. © 2021, The Author(s).",Cancer risk; CEP72; Deletion structural variants; MUC4; Whole-genome sequencing,"K ras protein; manganese superoxide dismutase; mucin 4; mucin 6; protein p53; regulatory associated protein of mTOR; SHC transforming protein 3; silicon; CEP72 protein, human; microtubule associated protein; MUC4 protein, human; mucin 4; ADAP1 gene; ADCY8 gene; ADCY9 gene; adult; aged; Article; AURKAPS1 gene; B3GNTL1 gene; breast cancer; CACN gene; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer risk; cancer susceptibility; CBX3 gene; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; colorectal carcinoma; controlled study; CTP4FI2 gene; CYP4FI1 gene; ERC1 gene; female; female genital tract cancer; GALNT9 gene; gene deletion; gene expression; GNG2 gene; hereditary tumor syndrome; human; human cell; IFIT1 gene; immune response gene; KCNMB2 gene; LHFPL3 gene; MAGE1 gene; MAGEA1 gene; major clinical study; male; MYT1 gene; ovary carcinoma; PPP6R2 gene; PSMA8 gene; RAB3GAP2 gene; recurrence free survival; recurrent disease; SBF2 gene; SDSM2 gene; SMYD3 gene; support vector machine; Taiwan; tumor microenvironment; UNCD13B gene; whole genome sequencing; colorectal tumor; gene deletion; gene expression regulation; genetic predisposition; genetics; germline mutation; immunity; immunology; middle aged; pathology; Adult; Aged; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Germ-Line Mutation; Humans; Immunity; Male; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Middle Aged; Mucin-4; Sequence Deletion; Tumor Microenvironment","Chiang, J.-H.; Institute of Medical Informatics, Taiwan; 電子郵件: jchiang@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099217638

We create a pipeline that can contextualize genes by using text-mined co-occurrence features. We apply Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) techniques for literature mining in the cancer gene panel. A literature-derived 4,679 × 4,630 gene term-feature matrix was built. The EGFR L858R and T790M, and BRAF V600E genetic variants are important mutation term features in text mining and are frequently mutated in cancer. We validate the cancer gene panel by the mutational landscape of different cancer types. The cosine similarity of gene frequency between text mining and a statistical result from clinical sequencing data is 80.8%. In different machine learning models, the best accuracy for the prediction of two different gene panels, including MSK-IMPACT (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets), and Oncomine cancer gene panel, is 0.959, and 0.989, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis confirmed that the neural net model has a better prediction performance (Area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.992). The use of text-mined co-occurrence features can contextualize each gene. We believe the approach is to evaluate several existing gene panels, and show that we can use part of the gene panel set to predict the remaining genes for cancer discovery.

Comfortable sensing and accurate analysis in sleep monitoring is beneficial to many healthcare and medical applications. From 2020, owing to the COVID‑19 pandemic that spreads between people when they come into close physical contact with one another, the willingness to go to hospital for receiving care has reduced; care-at-home is the trend in modern healthcare. Therefore, a home-use and real-time sleep-staging system is developed in this paper. Methods: We developed and implemented a real-time sleep staging system that integrates a wearable eye mask for high-quality electroencephalogram/electrooculogram measurement and a mobile device with MobileNETV2 deep learning model for sleep-stage identification. In the experiments, 25 all-night recordings were acquired, 17 of which were used for training, and the remaining eight were used for testing. Results: The averaged scoring agreements for the wake, light sleep, deep sleep, and rapid eye movement stages were 85.20%, 87.17%, 82.87%, and 89.30%, respectively, for our system compared with the manual scoring of PSG recordings. In addition, the mean absolute errors of four objective sleep measurements, including sleep efficiency, total sleep time, sleep onset time, and wake after sleep onset time were 1.68%, 7.56 min, 5.50 min, and 3.94 min, respectively. No significant differences were observed between the proposed system and manual PSG scoring in terms of the percentage of each stage and the objective sleep measurements. Conclusion: These experimental results demonstrate that our system provides high scoring agreements in sleep staging and unbiased sleep measurements owing to the use of EEG and EOG signals and powerful mobile computing based on deep learning networks. These results also suggest that our system is applicable for home-use real-time sleep monitoring. © 2021, Taiwanese Society of Biomedical Engineering.",Automatic sleep-staging method; EEG; EOG; Eye mask; Home use; Mobile platform; MobileNetV2; Real time,Electroencephalography; Eye movements; Learning systems; Medical applications; mHealth; Sleep research; Wakes; Accurate analysis; Human activities; Learning network; Mean absolute error; Physical contacts; Rapid eye movement; Sleep efficiencies; Sleep monitoring; Deep learning; adult; Article; deep learning; electroencephalogram; electrooculogram; female; human; human experiment; male; REM sleep; scoring system; sleep; sleep efficiency; sleep stage; sleep time; sleep waking cycle; slow wave sleep; stage 1 sleep; stage 2 sleep; young adult,"Liang, S.-F.; Dept. of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: sfliang@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114180020

A protein-protein interaction might play different roles in diverse cancer types. Hence, prioritizing the PPIs in each cancer type would help detect cancer-associated pathways, find a better understanding of cancer biology, and facilitate drug discovery. Several studies to date have proposed computational methods for extracting the PPI essentiality of different cancer types based on the PPI network. The main drawback of these studies is not using a rich source such as genomics variant data. An amino acid sequence encodes useful information about protein structure and behavior. We represent each amino acid sequence based on its variants/mutations in seven different ways: binary vectors, pathogenicity scores, binding affinity changes upon mutations, gene expression-based network of the interactions, biophysicochemical properties, g-gap dipeptide, and one-hot vectors. Based on these representations, we design and consider seven different deep learning models. Then, we compare the accuracy of these models in predicting 20 different cancer types from the TCGA cohort. WinBinVec is a window-based model that outperforms the other models.

Accurate pattern diagnosis requires reliable and valid diagnostic instruments that guide the collection of TCM clinical data without bias. This study synthesised the existing TCM diagnostic instruments for functional dyspepsia (FD) and appraised their quality regarding their development process and measurement properties. Methods: Seven electronic databases were searched for validation studies on TCM diagnostic instruments for FD. Synthesis and appraisal of the included studies were performed following the COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) Initiative guidelines adapted for TCM diagnostic instruments. Risk of bias assessment was conducted using the COSMIN Risk of Bias Checklist. Results: Five studies were included, with five unique TCM diagnostic instruments for FD identified. All five diagnostic instruments were of inadequate quality in terms of their development process, implying a shortcoming in their relevance, comprehensibility, and comprehensiveness. Only the criterion validity of Stomach Qi Deficiency Pattern Assessment Scale was of sufficient quality and had no risk of bias in its validation. Conclusion: The quality of TCM diagnostic instruments for FD warrants urgent improvements. None of them was considered reliable or valid for guiding TCM pattern diagnosis. To support the evidence base of the standardization of TCM patterns in ICD-11, TCM diagnostic instruments should be developed and validated rigorously under the COSMIN guidelines. Amendments should be made on the guidelines to accommodate the features and uniqueness of TCM diagnostic process. © 2020",Chinese traditional; Dyspepsia; Medicine; Psychometrics; Surveys and questionnaires; Systematic review; Validation study,adolescent; adult; aged; Chinese medicine; criterion related validity; diagnostic test accuracy study; digestive system disease assessment; digestive system function disorder; dyspepsia; evaluation study; female; human; ICD-11; male; middle aged; Review; risk assessment; Stomach Qi Deficiency Pattern Assessment Scale; systematic review,"Chung, V.C.; School of Public Health and Primary Care, Room 413, Hong Kong; 電子郵件: vchung@cuhk.edu.hk",English,Review,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101406797

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) observations prove that the deposited films have a c-axis preferred orientation. Effective d33 value of the proposed films is 5.92 pm/V, which is better than most of the reported data using DC sputtering or other processing methods. It is found that the gun placed at 25° helped the films to rearrange at low temperature and c-axis orientation AlN films were successfully grown at 100 °C. This temperature is much lower than the reported growing temperature. It means the piezoelectric films can be deposited at flexible substrate and the photoresist can be stable at this temperature.

Based on different symptoms of the patient, needling or massaging is applied to the corresponding acupuncture points to relieve the symptoms. However, given the large number of acupuncture points and the complexity of their specifities, it is difficult for one to remember the location and function of each acupuncture point without extensive training. In this work, through the use of augmented reality (AR), the acupuncture points can be displayed directly on the image of human body. Compared to existing acupoint probe devices that work by measuring the skin conductivity, our solution does not require any additional hardware and is purely software-based.

However, the ultrasound (US) image quality and operator experience affect the accuracy. We present an automatic system that enables precise fetal MSP detection from three-dimensional (3D) US and provides an evaluation of its performance using a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework. Method: The neural network is designed as a filter and generates masks to obtain the MSP, learning the features and MSP location in 3D space. Using the proposed image analysis system, a seed point was obtained from 218 first-trimester fetal 3D US volumes using deep learning and the MSP was automatically extracted. Results: The experimental results reveal the feasibility and excellent performance of the proposed approach between the automatically and manually detected MSPs. There was no significant difference between the semi-automatic and automatic systems. Further, the inference time in the automatic system was up to two times faster than the semi-automatic approach. Conclusion: The proposed system offers precise fetal MSP measurements. Therefore, this automatic fetal MSP detection and measurement approach is anticipated to be useful clinically.

It is a powerful signal processing tool and has received increasing attention in recent years. SpEn has been successfully applied in biomedical measurements and other applications. In particular, many emerging applications require measuring the SpEn of signals in real-time embedded systems. However, the standard implementation of SpEn requires a computational complexity of O(n2), where n is the data length, making it difficult to meet real-time constraints, especially for large n. Moreover, power consumption and computation latency must be considered as well. The data length used in previous studies was approximately several hundred, and it remains a challenging task to operate on longer data lengths. In this article, we propose the assisted sliding box (SBOX) algorithm to accelerate the computation of SpEn without any approximation while maintaining a low memory overhead so that the algorithm can be executed in embedded systems for edge computing. We also develop an electroencephalogram (EEG)-based wearable device for comfortable overnight recording. The SBOX algorithm is then implemented in the system to measure the online SpEn of an overnight sleep EEG signal. The results show that, compared with the standard algorithm, the SBOX algorithm speeds up the computation time by a factor of 60, thereby reducing power consumption by 98% when measuring a 30-s epoch of sleep EEG with n=7500 and a 250-Hz sampling rate. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",Computation time; edge computing; microcontroller (MCU); sample entropy (SpEn); sleep electroencephalogram (EEG); wearable device,Approximation algorithms; Costs; Electric power utilization; Electroencephalography; Entropy; Online systems; Real time systems; Signal processing; Sleep research; Wearable computers; Biomedical measurements; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Emerging applications; On-line analysis; Real time constraints; Real-time embedded systems; Standard algorithms; Wearable devices; Embedded systems,"Wang, Y.-H.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: yunghung@ncu.edu.tw

In this study, a streaking detection method is proposed for evaluating and optimizing quantitative susceptibility maps. Methods: Nine healthy subjects participated in this study and underwent three-dimensional multi-echo gradient echo scans. Regularized iterative algorithm was used for reconstruction of tissue susceptibility maps in all subjects. Streaking detection was applied to evaluate streaking artifact in tissue susceptibility maps. In addition, an optimization process for QSM reconstruction by streaking detection was applied and was compared with matching noise level method. Results: It is shown that the proposed streaking detection technique effectively delineates streaking artifact in tissue susceptibility maps. In QSM reconstruction, optimization by streaking detection successfully determines the regularization factor that balances between streaking artifact suppression and tissue texture preservation. ROI analyses of brain tissue susceptibility show that optimization by streaking detection achieves results in good agreement with that from matching noise level method. Conclusions: Streaking detection enables direct visualization of streaking patterns in tissue susceptibility maps. It can be applied both for evaluating QSM reconstruction quality and for comparing different reconstruction algorithms. Furthermore, streaking detection can be incorporated into an optimization process of QSM reconstruction.

Whereas previous studies have evaluated spatial relationships using still frame images, we aimed to train and test a deep neural network for video analysis by combining spatial and temporal information, to automate the recognition of left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities. Methods: We collected a series of transthoracic echocardiography examinations performed between July 2017 and April 2018 in 2 tertiary care hospitals. Regional wall abnormalities were defined by experienced physiologists and confirmed by trained cardiologists. First, we developed a 3-dimensional convolutional neural network model for view selection ensuring stringent image quality control. Second, a U-net model segmented images to annotate the location of each left ventricular wall. Third, a final 3-dimensional convolutional neural network model evaluated echocardiographic videos from 4 standard views, before and after segmentation, and calculated a wall motion abnormality confidence level (0-1) for each segment. To evaluate model stability, we performed 5-fold cross-validation and external validation. Results: In a series of 10 638 echocardiograms, our view selection model identified 6454 (61%) examinations with sufficient image quality in all standard views. In this training set, 2740 frames were annotated to develop the segmentation model, which achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.756. External validation was performed in 1756 examinations from an independent hospital. A regional wall motion abnormality was observed in 8.9% and 4.9% in the training and external validation datasets, respectively. The final model recognized regional wall motion abnormalities in the cross-validation and external validation datasets with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.912 (95% CI, 0.896-0.928) and 0.891 (95% CI, 0.834-0.948), respectively. In the external validation dataset, the sensitivity was 81.8% (95% CI, 73.8%-88.2%), and specificity was 81.6% (95% CI, 80.4%-82.8%). Conclusions: In echocardiographic examinations of sufficient image quality, it is feasible for deep neural networks to automate the recognition of regional wall motion abnormalities using temporal and spatial information from moving images. Further investigation is required to optimize model performance and evaluate clinical applications. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

In comparison with the current available medical modalities, the contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging is the simplest and fastest means for probing the tissue perfusion. Specifically, the perfusion parameters estimated from the ultrasound time-intensity curve (TIC) and statistics-based time–Nakagami parameter curve (TNC) approaches were found able to quantify the perfusion. However, due to insufficient tolerance on tissue clutters and subresolvable effects, these approaches remain short of reproducibility and robustness. Consequently, the window-modulated compounding (WMC) Nakagami parameter ratio imaging was proposed to alleviate these effects, by taking the ratio of WMC Nakagami parameters corresponding to the incidence of two different acoustic pressures from an employed transducer. The time–Nakagami parameter ratio curve (TNRC) approach was also developed to estimate perfusion parameters. Measurements for the assessment of muscle perfusion were performed from the flow phantom and animal subjects administrated with a bolus of ultrasound contrast agents. The TNRC approach demonstrated better sensitivity and tolerance of tissue clutters than those of TIC and TNC. The fusion image with the WMC Nakagami parameter ratio and B-mode images indicated that both the tissue structures and perfusion properties of ultrasound contrast agents may be better discerned. © 2020 by the authors.

A particular case is the investigation into the off-target effects of N-methylpyrrole-N-methylimidazole polyamides, a naturally inspired class of DNA binders with strong affinity to the minor-groove and sequence specificity, but at < 20 bases, their relatively short motifs also insinuate the possibility of non-unique genomic binding. Binding at non-intended loci potentially lead to the rise of off-target effects, issues that very few approaches are able to address to-date. We here report an analytical method to infer off-target binding, via expression profiling, based on probing the relative impact to various biochemical pathways; we also proposed an accompanying side effect prediction engine for the systematic screening of candidate polyamides. This method marks the first attempt in PI polyamide research to identify elements in biochemical pathways that are sensitive to the treatment of a candidate polyamide as an approach to infer possible off-target effects. Expression changes were then considered to assess possible outward phenotypic changes, manifested as side effects, should the same PI polyamide candidate be administered clinically. We validated some of these effects with a series of animal experiments, and found agreeable corroboration in certain side effects, such as changes in aspartate transaminase levels in ICR and nude mice post-administration. © 2019 Lin et al.

The most familiar method to detect ADRs is relying on spontaneous reports. Unfortunately, the low reporting rate of spontaneous reports is a serious limitation of pharmacovigilance. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify a method to detect potential ADRs of drugs automatically using a deep neural network (DNN). Methods: We designed a DNN model that utilizes the chemical, biological, and biomedical information of drugs to detect ADRs. This model aimed to fulfill two main purposes: identifying the potential ADRs of drugs and predicting the possible ADRs of a new drug. For improving the detection performance, we distributed representations of the target drugs in a vector space to capture the drug relationships using the word-embedding approach to process substantial biomedical literature. Moreover, we built a mapping function to address new drugs that do not appear in the dataset. Results: Using the drug information and the ADRs reported up to 2009, we predicted the ADRs of drugs recorded up to 2012. There were 746 drugs and 232 new drugs, which were only recorded in 2012 with 1325 ADRs. The experimental results showed that the overall performance of our model with mean average precision at top-10 achieved is 0.523 and the rea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score achieved is 0.844 for ADR prediction on the dataset. Conclusions: Our model is effective in identifying the potential ADRs of a drug and the possible ADRs of a new drug. Most importantly, it can detect potential ADRs irrespective of whether they have been reported in the past. © Chi-Shiang Wang, Pei-Ju Lin, Ching-Lan Cheng, Shu-Hua Tai, Yea-Huei Kao Yang, Jung-Hsien Chiang.",Adverse drug reactions; Deep neural network; Drug representation; Machine learning; Pharmacovigilance,"drug surveillance program; human; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer","Chiang, J.-H.; Institute of Medical Informatics, Taiwan; 電子郵件: jchiang@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061124203

A smart grid can deliver various types of electrical services and streamlined, highly efficient energy consumption, but only if its communication systems are highly reliable. A smart grid can be based on wireless networks, which offer high speed and low cost, but problems with wireless technology can impair communications performance and destabilize the smart grid. Wireless local area network (LAN) mesh networks based on IEEE 802.11s can serve as the backbones of smart grids. IEEE 802.11s provides flexible, scalable, high-speed communications with low installation and management costs. In this paper, we first describe IEEE 802.11s, default routing protocol, Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (HWMP); Even though HWMP has several shortcomings that destabilize smart grids, we propose a novel scheme to improve smart grid routing reliability. We present a simulation of our proposed scheme using ns-3 simulation software, and prove that our method can improve smart grid reliability. © 2013 IEEE.",IEEE 80211s; Neighborhood area network; reliability; smart grid; wireless mesh networks,Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; IEEE Standards; Mesh generation; MESH networking; Power management (telecommunication); Reliability; Software reliability; Wireless mesh networks (WMN); Electrical services; High-speed communications; Hybrid wireless mesh protocols (HWMP); IEEE 80211s; Smart grid; Two-way transmission; Wireless local area network (LAN); Wireless technologies; Smart power grids,"Hsieh, S.-Y.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: hsiehsy@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078038759

Curvature estimation provides a powerful index to evaluate the deformation severity of scoliosis. In current clinical diagnosis, the standard curvature estimation method for assessing the curvature quantitatively is done by measuring the Cobb angle, which is the angle between two lines, drawn perpendicular to the upper endplate of the uppermost vertebra involved and the lower endplate of the lowest vertebra involved. However, manual measurement of spine curvature requires considerable time and effort, along with associated problems such as interobserver and intraobserver variations. In this article, we propose an automatic system for measuring spine curvature using the anterior-posterior (AP) view spinal X-ray images. Due to the characteristic of AP view images, we first reduced the image size and then used horizontal and vertical intensity projection histograms to define the region of interest of the spine which is then cropped for sequential processing. Next, the boundaries of the spine, the central spinal curve line, and the spine foreground are detected by using intensity and gradient information of the region of interest, and a progressive thresholding approach is then employed to detect the locations of the vertebrae. In order to reduce the influences of inconsistent intensity distribution of vertebrae in the spine AP image, we applied the deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches which include the U-Net, the Dense U-Net, and Residual U-Net, to segment the vertebrae. Finally, the segmentation results of the vertebrae are reconstructed into a complete segmented spine image, and the spine curvature is calculated based on the Cobb angle criterion. In the experiments, we showed the results for spine segmentation and spine curvature; the results were then compared to manual measurements by specialists. The segmentation results of the Residual U-Net were superior to the other two convolutional neural networks. The one-way ANOVA test also demonstrated that the three measurements including the manual records of two different physicians and our proposed measured record were not significantly different in terms of spine curvature measurement. Looking forward, the proposed system can be applied in clinical diagnosis to assist doctors for a better understanding of scoliosis severity and for clinical treatments. © 2019 Ming-Huwi Horng et al.",,"Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Image segmentation; Musculoskeletal system; Curvature estimation; Curvature measurement; Gradient informations; Intensity distribution; Intraobserver variations; Projection histograms; Segmentation results; Sequential processing; Convolutional neural networks; anterior-posterior patterning; Article; cervical vertebra; clinical evaluation; Cobb angle; convolutional neural network; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic test accuracy study; head; hip; histogram; human; image processing; image segmentation; imaging and display; intervertebral disk; lumbar vertebra; machine learning; null hypothesis; physician; quantitative analysis; sensitivity and specificity; sibling; spine; statistical analysis; thoracic vertebra; X ray; artificial neural network; biology; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; mathematical computing; pathology; scoliosis; spine; three dimensional imaging; Computational Biology; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Mathematical Computing; Neural Networks (Computer); Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Scoliosis; Spine","Sun, Y.-N.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: ynsun@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062632775
