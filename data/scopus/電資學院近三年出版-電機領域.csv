To improve the characteristics of the RRAM such as high endurance operation and high resistance switching stability, silicon dopants were doped into AlN films by using the cosputtering method. Then, the influence of the concentration of silicon doping on the bipolar switching characteristics of AlN-based RRAM was studied. The research results show that the on/off ratio of the device after silicon doping has increased from 10 to about 1000, the set voltage has reduced from 2.5 to 1.9 V, and the reset voltage has reduced from ?1.5 to ?1.1 V. The stability of resistance switching (RS) is also improved. Besides, it is found that silicon doping helps to lower the instability caused by the oxygen ions and increased the endurance cycle (&gt;2.5 × 106 cycles).

Comparing the unannealed and microwave-annealed samples whose temperature is controlled at 200–500? C, APALD non-vacuum deposited film can be realized with a higher film deposition rate, which is beneficial for increasing the production throughput while at the same time reducing the operating cost of vacuum equipment at hand. Since the microwave has a greater penetration depth during the process, the resultant thermal energy provided can be spread out evenly to the entire wafer, thereby achieving the effect of rapid annealing. The film thickness is subsequently analyzed by TEM, whereas the chemical composition is verified by EDS and XPS. The negative fixed charge and interface trap density are analyzed by the C-V measurement method.

The traditional evaluation scheme to gauge the performance of the transistor 'per effective channel width' is shown to be improper due to pervasive bulk inversion. Bulk inversion, along the width of the nanosheet and at its ends, obfuscates the dependence of current on sheet/channel width and undermines the presumed added benefit of short-channel effect (SCE) control in the GAA device. The NSFET provides a flexible sheet width, as opposed to that of the FinFET with discrete fins, but the allowed range of sheet width is limited due to significant parasitic capacitance at a relatively narrow width and degraded SCE control and increased resistance for desired wide width. Furthermore, the nanosheet (NS) device density is undermined at a narrow width, especially for decreasing pitch. The FinFET is shown to be a favorable alternative to the NSFET even at the G40M16 node. ? 1963-2012 IEEE.",Bulk inversion; device density; effective channel width; FinFET; footprint; gate capacitance; NSFET; S-D series resistance; short-channel effects (SCEs),Capacitance; Electric resistance; FinFET; Fins (heat exchange); Gallium; Gallium arsenide; III-V semiconductors; Nanosheets; Bulk inversion; Channel widths; Conductivity; Device density; Effective channel width; Footprint; Gate capacitance; Nanoscale device; NSFET; Resistance; S-D series resistance; Series resistances; Short-channel effect; Short-channel effect .; Threshold voltage,"Chiang, M.-H.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: mhchiang@mail.ncku.edu.tw

And researchers found out that piRNA also regulates various endogenous transcripts. However, there is no systematic understanding of the piRNA binding patterns and how piRNA targets genes. While various prediction methods have been developed for other similar ncRNAs (e.g., miRNAs), piRNA holds distinctive characteristics and requires its own computational model for binding target prediction. Results: Recently, transcriptome-wide piRNA binding events in C. elegans were probed by PRG-1 CLASH experiments. Based on the probed piRNA-messenger RNAs (mRNAs) binding pairs, in this research, we devised the first deep learning architecture based on multi-head attention to computationally identify piRNA targeting mRNA sites. In the devised deep network, the given piRNA and mRNA segment sequences are first one-hot encoded and undergo a combined operation of convolution and squeezing-extraction to unravel motif patterns. And we incorporate a novel multi-head attention sub-network to extract the hidden piRNA binding rules that can simulate the biological piRNA target recognition process. Finally, the true piRNA–mRNA binding pairs are identified by a deep fully connected sub-network. Our model obtains a supreme discriminatory power of AUC = 93.3% on an independent test set and successfully extracts the verified binding pattern of a synthetic piRNA. These results demonstrated that the devised model achieves high prediction performance and suggests testable potential biological piRNA binding rules. Conclusions: In this research, we developed the first deep learning method to identify piRNA targeting sites on C. elegans mRNAs. And the developed deep learning method is demonstrated to be of high accuracy and can provide biological insights into piRNA–mRNA binding patterns.

Given the pivotal role of this plant to humans, botanical researchers and breeding communities should have access to valuable genomic and transcriptomic information of this plant. Previously, we established OrchidBase, which contains expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from different tissues and developmental stages of Phalaenopsis as well as biotic and abiotic stress-treated Phalaenopsis. The database includes floral transcriptomic sequences from 10 orchid species across all the five subfamilies of Orchidaceae. Description: Recently, the whole-genome sequences of Apostasia shenzhenica, Dendrobium catenatum, and Phalaenopsis equestris were de novo assembled and analyzed. These datasets were used to develop OrchidBase 4.0, including genomic and transcriptomic data for these three orchid species. OrchidBase 4.0 offers information for gene annotation, gene expression with fragments per kilobase of transcript per millions mapped reads (FPKM), KEGG pathways and BLAST search. In addition, assembled genome sequences and location of genes and miRNAs could be visualized by the genome browser. The online resources in OrchidBase 4.0 can be accessed by browsing or using BLAST. Users can also download the assembled scaffold sequences and the predicted gene and protein sequences of these three orchid species. Conclusions: OrchidBase 4.0 is the first database that contain the whole-genome sequences and annotations of multiple orchid species.

An inference-than-planning framework is proposed for solving the parking slot searching using a zero-information distributed model with an availability inference for parking slots in areas with no sensor coverage. Meanwhile, a proposed Conntrans algorithm is suggested as a two-stage structure with three relaxing policies: adjacent cruising, on-orbital annealing, and orbital transitioning. The evaluation is conducted based on the simulation in a publicly accessible real-world parking data from SFPark in San Francisco; the area is divided into 3 separated regions with different urban characteristics. Overall results show that the proposed availability inference model can retrieve decent performance.

Through machine learning, we are able to capture the potential interactions between urban dynamics and find their mutual interactions in a spatial context. However, despite a plethora of traffic-related studies, few works have explored predicting the impact of congestion. Therefore, this paper focuses on predicting how a car accident leads to traffic congestion, especially the length of time it takes for the congestion to occur. Accordingly, we propose a novel model named Dual-Attention Multi-Scale Graph Convolutional Networks (DAMGNet) to address this issue. In this proposed model, heterogeneous data such as accident information, urban dynamics, and various highway network characteristics are considered and combined. Next, the context encoder encodes the accident data, and the spatial encoder captures the hidden features between multi-scale Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). With our designed dual attention mechanism, the DAMGNet model is able to effectively learn the correlation between features. The evaluations conducted on a real-world dataset prove that our DAMGNet has a significant improvement in RMSE and MAE over other comparative methods. ? 2021 ACM.",Delay Time Prediction; Dual attention; Multi-scale GCN; Traffic accidents,Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Graph neural networks; Highway accidents; Learning systems; Motor transportation; Signal encoding; Traffic congestion; Convolutional networks; Delay Time; Delay time prediction; Dual attention; Multi-scale graph convolutional network; Multi-scales; Time predictions; Traffic-related; Transportation policies; Urban dynamics; Forecasting,"Hsieh, H.-P.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: hphsieh@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119176996

The adaptive stereo matching subsys-tem, which adaptively uses color gradient, color intensity and texture census costs, can reduce the most of computation and achieve good primary depth maps. The recursive re-finement subsystem consists of median filtering, left-right check, hole filling, and bilat-eral filtering functions. The refinement subsystem is performed recursively to reduce the most errors occurred in occlusion regions such that we can obtain high-precision depth maps. Finally, the depth upsizing subsystem by referring original high-resolution images performs depth value upscaling, texture-selected interpolation, and weighted depth vot-ing processes to finally obtain the high-precision and high-resolution depth maps.

Thus, reducing energy consumption is a critical issue for the success of IoT. Recently, Wake-up Radios (WuRs) play a key role in minimizing the energy consumption by providing wake-up calls to IoT devices which are currently in a low-power sleep mode to conserve energy. On receiving a pre-defined pattern called a Wake-up Token (WuT) over the WuR, the IoT device wakes up in order to process information and/or conduct communications. However, WuR-based IoT devices are susceptible to malicious attacks, such as Denial-of-Sleep attacks designed to drain the device of its energy, or cloning attacks designed to impersonate a legitimate IoT device and perform various nefarious activities. To address these problems, the present study proposes a novel one-time wake-up token using the Physical Unclonable Function (PUF). In addition, to prevent the WuT from becoming desynchronized thereby resulting in a connection loss, a WuT resynchronization scheme is designed to maintain a constant state of synchronization between the WuTs of the gateway and the IoT devices, respectively. Finally, the proposed schemes are extended to support group wake-up and resynchronization procedures, respectively, in order to enhance the communication efficiency and improve the energy conservation.

Modified from the total-cross-tied (TCT) configuration, the connection and physical location of the modules in a PV array are rearranged based on the complementary SuDoKu puzzle patterns so as to distribute the PSC effects over the entire array. In addition, to mitigate the common corner-shading patterns in a PV array, which are typically caused by the direction of the sunlight or mutual module shadings, the proposed topology makes use of an especially-designed complementary diagonal circuit arrangement. For the purpose of validation, six PSC cases are considered, and the output of a PV array configured using the proposed CSDKP topology is evaluated and compared with four other topologies. The evaluation results demonstrated that the CSDKP offered the lowest averaged power loss (12.86%) and the highest averaged maximum-power improvement (14.6%) among the five topologies. The advantages of the proposed method include easy implementation with simple rules, simplification of the P-V curves, and a reduction in the cost of maximum power point tracking.

DND-WS2 samples were prepared by a sonication-assisted (van der Waals interaction) liquid-phase exfoliation process in low-boiling solvents with DND as a surfactant. The samples were further hydrothermally treated in an autoclave under high pressure and temperature. The as-prepared samples were separated as two parts named DND-WS2 BH (before hydrothermal) and DND-WS2 AH (after hydrothermal). The exfoliated bilayer to few-layer DND-doped WS2 nanosheets were confirmed by ultraviolet-visible spectra, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy studies. It was observed that the DND powder not only acted as a surfactant but also doped and expanded on WS2 nanosheets. The difference between samples BH and AH treatment was further investigated using Raman spectroscopy. The WS2 and DND-WS2 samples on SiO2/Si were fabricated using a sputtered Pd/Ag interdigitated electrode and utilized for H2 gas-sensing measurements. Surprisingly, the DND-WS2 exhibits an ultrahigh sensor response of 72.8% to H2 at 500 ppm when compared to only 9.9% for WS2 alone. Also, the DND-WS2 shows a fast response/recovery time, high selectivity, and stability toward H2 gas. It can be attributed to the correlation of the intergrain phase of DND nanoparticles and WS2 nanosheets, which contributes to the easy transportation of charge carriers when exposed to the air and H2 gas atmosphere. Moreover, it is believed that DND-induced WS2 exfoliation might inspire future synthesis of transition metal dichalcogenides induced by DND in green solvents. ? 2021 American Chemical Society.",detonation nanodiamond (DND); DND-doped WS2; low-boiling solvents; LPE process; WS2,Density functional theory; Detonation; Exfoliation (materials science); High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrogen; Molybdenum compounds; Nanodiamonds; Nanosheets; Silicon; Solvents; Surface active agents; Transition metals; Tungsten compounds; Van der Waals forces; Boiling solvents; Detonation nanodiamond; Detonation nanodiamond-doped WS2; H2-sensing; Hydrogen sensing properties; Low-boiling solvent; LPE process; Sensing property; Sulfur compounds,"Huang, B.-R.; Graduate Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: huangbr@mail.ntust.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117162825

Through this method, the mobile data traffic load over a cellular network is mitigated by offloading some of the traffic to an alternative path; usually a WiFi network. Most previous studies on WiFi offloading have assumed that the data traffic is offloaded to a path with constant bandwidth. However, in real-world applications, it is generally impossible to perform data transmission at a constant rate through WiFi over the entire offloading process, Hence, one of the most challenging issues in analyzing the performance of mobile data offloading is that of evaluating the effects of bandwidth uncertainty on the actual transmission rate. Accordingly, the present study proposes an analytical model for predicting the performance of multipath data offloading over WiFi network with bandwidth uncertainty. The theoretical results are validated by means of numerical simulations. The effectiveness of the proposed model is then further investigated by comparing the QoS metrics of the data offloading process with those obtained in a previous study on mobile data offloading under the assumption of a constant bandwidth. Overall, as the WiFi connection times are highly larger than the WiFi disconnection times, our model removes estimated errors in the baseline model by 8.7% and 6.7% in deadline miss ratio, by 23.2% and 14.9% in average offloading volume, when we consider two and three varying WiFi bandwidth respectively. The results show that the proposed method provides mobile operators with an effective framework for maintaining the QoS level of mobile data offloading in real-world networks characterized by WiFi bandwidth uncertainty. ? 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Bandwidth uncertainty; LTE; MPTCP; Performance modeling; WiFi offloading,Mobile telecommunication systems; Quality of service; Uncertainty analysis; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Bandwidth uncertainty; LTE; Mobile data offloading; MPTCP; Multipath; Performance Modeling; Quality-of-service; Uncertainty; Wi Fi networks; Wi-Fi offloading; Bandwidth,"Sou, S.-I.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: sisou@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111258218

The CAVs are supported by vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication to achieve those goals. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standardizes the V2X called cellular V2X (C-V2X). In the real application, the CAVs should deal with mixed traffic scenarios during its penetration in the highways. The term mixed traffic refers to the traffic that consisted of human driving and CAVs. This paper considers that human driving is an unconnected vehicle and has a jerky driving behavior. Hence, when the CAVs interacted with human driving vehicles, CAVs required large spacing between vehicles to provide safety and comfortable driving. It will sacrifice the road capacity where the spacing between vehicles is large. This paper proposes the cooperative perception strategy using C-V2X to mitigate the adverse effect of unconnected vehicles without sacrificing safety and comfortable driving. The errors during transmission such as propagation error, half-duplex error, packet sensing ratio error, and message collision are considered.

This article takes a different approach from that of previous legal prediction research. It analyzes and predicts whether two parties in a dispute can reach an agreement peacefully through the conciliation of mediation. With the inference result, we can know whether mediation is a more practical and time-saving method to solve the dispute. Existing works about legal case prediction mostly focus on prosecution or criminal cases. In this work, we propose a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based framework, called LSTMEnsembler, to predict mediation results by assembling multiple classifiers. Among these classifiers, some are powerful for modeling the numerical and categorical features of case information, for example, XGBoost and LightGBM. Some are effective for dealing with textual data, for example, TextCNN and BERT. The proposed LSTMEnsembler aims to not only combine the effectiveness of different classifiers intelligently but also to capture temporal dependencies from previous cases to boost the performance of mediation prediction.

In particular, when the system undergoes low-speed or reversal motions, the inherent friction force and/or external disturbances may degrade motion accuracy. Therefore, in order to achieve satisfactory motion accuracy, it is necessary to suppress the adverse effects due to friction and/or dis-turbance. In order to deal with the aforementioned problem often encountered in motion control applica-tions, this paper develops a disturbance compensation approach, which is called Nominal-plant-based Disturbance Compensator (NDC). The advantage of the proposed NDC is that it not only can accurately estimate external disturbance/load torque, but also has superior ability in external disturbance suppression and measurement noise reduction. To address the properties of the proposed approach, theoretical analy-sis of the transfer functions for different schemes are derived first.

Additionally, the conductive gel between the electrodes and skin could evaporate in long-term usage and deteriorate the signal quality. To address these issues, in this work, textile electrodes integrated with a clothing belt are proposed to achieve EIT lung imaging along with a custom portable EIT system. The simulation and experimental results have verified the validity of the proposed portable EIT system.

However, the nature of brachytherapy, organ deformities, metal induced artifacts caused by applicators, and limited operating time make this process a challenge. Deep learning segmentation has recently emerged as an approach to this problem. The basic concept proposed in this paper is accurate segmentation of a pelvic computed tomography image dataset such that patients can obtain more accurate radiotherapy. Methods: In this work, we propose a solution based on 3D U-Net and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The model was trained and tested on a computed tomography pelvic image dataset comprising 51 patients who underwent 3D brachytherapy. The organs that required segmentation included the bladder, bowels, sigmoid colon, rectum, and uterus. We also used self-ensemble to improve segmentation accuracy. The Dice coefficient was used as the evaluation metric to determine the segmentation results for all of the organs under consideration. Results: The proposed model was evaluated using organ segmentation obtained from 10 patients with newly diagnosed stage I-IVA cervical cancer. The test results showed that segmentation conducted using the proposed model resulted in the following Dice coefficient values (mean, ± standard deviation): 87 (± 6.3) %, 72 (± 9.1) %, 72 (± 7.8) %, 95 (± 3.5) %, 86 (± 4.9) %, 77 (± 8.4) %, 73 (± 10.2) %, and 93 (± 3.5) % for the HRCTV, GTV, bowels, foley, bladder, rectum, sigmoid colon, and uterus, respectively. Conclusion: This method shows that the combination of 3D U-Net and LSTM and self-ensemble post-processing has high potential for segmentation of a pelvic computed tomography dataset. ? 2021, Taiwanese Society of Biomedical Engineering.",3D U-net; Brachytherapy; Cervical cancer; LSTM; Pelvic computed tomography image; Segmentation; Self-ensemble,Computerized tomography; Diseases; Image segmentation; Long short-term memory; Oncology; Patient monitoring; 3d U-net; Brachytherapy; Cervical cancers; Computed tomography images; Dice coefficient; Image datasets; Pelvic computed tomography image; Segmentation; Self-ensemble; Sigmoids; Radiotherapy; Article; bladder; brachytherapy; cancer radiotherapy; clinical target volume; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; convolution algorithm; external beam radiotherapy; female; gross tumor volume; human; image segmentation; intestine; long short term memory network; major clinical study; measurement accuracy; pelvis radiography; rectum; sigmoid; three-dimensional imaging; uterine cervix cancer; uterus,"Chung, P.-C.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: pcchung@ee.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116044509

A three-dimensional cell capture and sensing array electrode (3D ECCSA) and an extremely-low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) were integrated for the real-time monitoring of human breast cancer cells for 12 h. The relationship between the cellular processes (cell-spreading stage, cell mitosis stage, and cell division stage) and the ELF-EMF can be analyzed using the electrical equivalent model, the impedance measurements in the experiment, and COMSOL simulations. This was the first time that a circuit model combined with MTs was used to analyze cancer cells under an ELF-EMF. MT impedance contains MT–cell membrane contact resistance(RMct), MT resistance (RMT), and MT capacitance (CMT). At the cell-spreading stage, the ELF-EMF-reduced assembly of the MTs impedes the cell spread, which leads to lower impedance variation. At the cell mitosis stage, the MT volume variation in the ELF-EMF group decreases faster than that in the control group, which indicates that the ELF-EMF influences the assembly of the MTs. In addition, the ELF-EMF impedes the assembly of the MTs between the mitotic spindles, and then the cells prolong the cell mitosis period, which can be analyzed through the cell impedance and our model. At cell division, the impedance increases because two daughter cells block more current. Our study showed that the novel model with MTs and a 3D ECCSA could analyze the cell mitosis process under an ELF-EMF. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Equivalent circuit model; Extremely-low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF); Microtubules (MTs); Single cell impedance; Three-dimensional cell capture and sensing array electrode (3D ECCSA),Cell proliferation; Circuit simulation; Diseases; Electric impedance; Electric impedance measurement; Electrodes; Electromagnetic fields; Cell mitosis; Equivalent circuit model; Extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields; Extremely-low-frequency electromagnetic field; Impedance measurement; MDA-MB-231; Microtubule; Microtubules; Single cell impedance; Three-dimensional cell capture and sensing array electrode (3d ECCSA); Equivalent circuits,"Wang, M.-H.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: wmh4@ulive.pccu.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112340953

Moreover, the spatiotemporal resolution of air pollution modelling approaches must be improved in order to achieve more accurate estimates. If not, the exposure assessments will not be applicable in future health risk assessments. To deal with this challenge, this study featured Land-Use Regression (LUR) models that use machine learning to assess the spatial-temporal variability of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). Daily average NO2 data was collected from 70 fixed air quality monitoring stations, belonging to the Taiwanese EPA, on the main island of Taiwan. Around 0.41 million observations from 2000 to 2016 were used for the analysis. Several datasets were employed to determine spatial predictor variables, including the EPA environmental resources dataset, the meteorological dataset, the land-use inventory, the landmark dataset, the digital road network map, the digital terrain model, MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index database, and the power plant distribution dataset. Regarding analyses, conventional LUR and Hybrid Kriging-LUR were performed first to identify important predictor variables. A Deep Neural Network, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms were then used to fit the prediction model based on the variables selected by the LUR models. Lastly, data splitting, 10-fold cross validation, external data verification, and seasonal-based and county-based validation methods were applied to verify the robustness of the developed models. The results demonstrated that the proposed conventional LUR and Hybrid Kriging-LUR models captured 65% and 78%, respectively, of NO2 variation. When the XGBoost algorithm was further incorporated in LUR and hybrid-LUR, the explanatory power increased to 84% and 91%, respectively. The Hybrid Kriging-LUR with XGBoost algorithm outperformed all other integrated methods. This study demonstrates the value of combining Hybrid Kriging-LUR model and an XGBoost algorithm to estimate the spatial-temporal variability of NO2 exposure. For practical application, the associations of specific land-use/land cover types selected in the final model can be applied in land-use management and in planning emission reduction strategies. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Land-use regression; Machine learning; NO2; Ordinary Kriging; Taiwan,Air quality; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Emission control; Environmental Protection Agency; Health risks; Interpolation; Motor transportation; Nitrogen oxides; Quality control; Risk assessment; Kriging; Land use regression; Land-use regression models; Machine-learning; NO $-2$; Ordinary kriging; Predictor variables; Spatial temporals; Taiwan; Temporal variability; Land use,"Wu, C.-D.; Department of Geomatics, No.1, University Road, Taiwan; 電子郵件: chidawu@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110744044

To overcome the code-dependent current-switching glitch effect, which seriously degrades the DAC linearity, a switching-glitch compensation (SGC) technique, which is realized with glitch duplicators, is proposed to generate a complementary amount of switching glitch at the DAC output. Hence, the amount of switching glitch at the DAC output becomes code-independent, thus improving the linearity of the DAC output. In addition, a decorrelator is proposed to randomize the mismatch effect of the glitch duplicators, thus eliminating the mismatch-induced spur at the DAC output spectrum. A 14-bit 10-GS/s non-return-to-zero (NRZ)/Mixing DAC with SGC is realized in 28-nm CMOS. Measurement results show that the spurious free-dynamic range (SFDR) is improved up to around 20 dB by the SGC. Therefore, this DAC with SGC achieves an SFDR >64 dBc over the entire first Nyquist zone and >50 dBc over the entire second Nyquist zone. Compared to prior state-of-the-art CMOS DACs with an output frequency (fout) ?3.4 GHz, this DAC with SGC achieves a 12.5-dB better SFDR with fout near 10 GHz and a 1.4x higher fout with an SFDR larger than 50 dBc. ? 1966-2012 IEEE.",Compensation; current steering; digital-to-analog converter (DAC); dynamic element matching (DEM); high linearity; layout arrangement; mixing; noise spectral density (NSD); non-return-to-zero (NRZ); output impedance; return-to-zero (RZ); spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR); switching glitch; third-order intermodulation distortion (IM3); wide bandwidth,CMOS integrated circuits; Digital to analog conversion; Current steering digital-to-analog converters; Current switching; Mismatch effects; Non-return to zeros; Output frequency; Output spectrum; Spurious free dynamic range; State of the art; Switching,"Kuo, T.-H.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: thkuo@ee.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107205803

Because the SIMO type buck converter uses only one inductor to buffer the transferred energy for the multiple output ports, it usually suffers from severe transient cross regulation in a continuous conduction mode. Most of the well-known approaches to suppress the transient cross regulation are either to create the additional free-wheeling loop or to refine the controller loop. The control logic is usually quite specific which may not apply to the other controller types controller. A phase sequence interchange (PSI) scheme is proposed to mitigate the transient cross regulation without modifying the original control design. Compared to the other techniques, the proposed method can be easily applied, but not limited to the compensator-based control or the non-compensator-based control in the buck converter. This study starts with the illustration of the reason why the PSI can mitigate the transient cross regulation. Detail designs are then presented to implement the proposed scheme on both the compensator type and the non-compensator type controls. Experimental results show that the suppression of the cross regulation is comparable to the other state of the arts. ? 2021 The Authors.

Although the relationship between oral cancer and microbiome was previously established, it remained controversial, and yet the ecological characteristics and their responses to oral carcinogenesis have not been well studied. Here, using the bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing along with the in silico function analysis by PICRUSt2 (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States 2), we systematically characterized the compositions and the ecological drivers of saliva microbiome in the cohorts of orally healthy, non-recurrent oral verrucous hyperplasia (a pre-cancer lesion), and oral verrucous hyperplasia–associated oral cancer at taxonomic and function levels, and compared them with the re-analysis of publicly available datasets. Diversity analyses showed that microbiome dysbiosis in saliva was significantly linked to oral health status. As oral health deteriorated, the number of core species declined, and metabolic pathways predicted by PICRUSt2 were dysregulated. Partitioned beta-diversity revealed an extremely high species turnover but low function turnover. Functional beta-diversity in saliva microbiome shifted from turnover to nestedness during oral carcinogenesis, which was not observed at taxonomic levels. Correspondingly, the quantitative analysis of stochasticity ratios showed that drivers of microbial composition and functional gene content of saliva microbiomes were primarily governed by the stochastic processes, yet the driver of functional gene content shifted toward deterministic processes as oral cancer developed. Re-analysis of publicly accessible datasets supported not only the distinctive family taxa of Veillonellaceae and Actinomycetaceae present in normal cohorts but also that Flavobacteriaceae and Peptostreptococcaceae as well as the dysregulated metabolic pathways of nucleotides, amino acids, fatty acids, and cell structure were related to oral cancer. Using predicted functional profiles to elucidate the correlations to the oral health status shows superior performance than using taxonomic data among different studies. These findings advance our understanding of the oral ecosystem in relation to oral carcinogenesis and provide a new direction to the development of microbiome-based tools to study the interplay of the oral microbiome, metabolites, and host health. ?

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) observations prove that the deposited films have a c-axis preferred orientation. Effective d33 value of the proposed films is 5.92 pm/V, which is better than most of the reported data using DC sputtering or other processing methods. It is found that the gun placed at 25° helped the films to rearrange at low temperature and c-axis orientation AlN films were successfully grown at 100 °C. This temperature is much lower than the reported growing temperature. It means the piezoelectric films can be deposited at flexible substrate and the photoresist can be stable at this temperature.

Unlike rendezvous or geometric formation, general topology pursuit allows the group of agents to autonomously form trochoid patterns, which are useful in civilian and military applications. However, this type of topology is established by designing a marginally stable system that may be sensitive to parameter variations. To account for this drawback of stability, linear fixed-gains are turned into a dynamical version in this paper. By implementing a disturbance observer controller, systems are shown to maintain their formation despite the disturbances or uncertainties. Comparison in the effectiveness of the presented method with model reference adaptive control and integral sliding mode control under the uncertainties of the gains is also conducted.

To avoid an inaccurate individual forecasting model, we propose an approach for a one-day to three-day ahead PV power hourly forecasting based on the stacking ensemble model with a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a meta-learner. The proposed approach is built by using real weather data and forecasted weather data in the training and testing stages, respectively. To accommodate uncertain weather, a daily clustering method based on statistical features, e.g., daily average, maximum, and standard deviation of PV power is applied in the data sets. Historical PV power output and weather data are used to train and test the model. The single learner considered in this research are artificial neural network, deep neural network, support vector regressions, long short-term memory, and convolutional neural network. Then, RNN is used to combine the forecasting results of each single learner. It is also important to observe the best combination of the single learners in this paper. Furthermore, to compare the performance of the proposed method, a random forest ensemble instead of RNN is used as a benchmark for comparison. Mean relative error (MRE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used as criteria to validate the accuracy of different forecasting models. The MRE of the proposed RNN ensemble learner model is 4.29%, which has significant improvements by about 7–40%, 7–30%, and 8% compared to the single models, the combinations of fewer single learners, and the benchmark method, respectively. The results show that the proposed method is promising for use in real PV power forecasting systems. ? 2021 by the authors.",Clustering method; Ensemble forecasting; PV power forecasting; Recurrent neural network,Benchmarking; Convolutional neural networks; Decision trees; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Learning systems; Meteorology; Photovoltaic cells; Support vector regression; Clustering methods; Forecasting modeling; Mean absolute error; Mean relative error; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Standard deviation; Statistical features; Training and testing; Recurrent neural networks,"Yang, H.-T.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: htyang@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112297430

In this study, an automatic water-level measurement system based on a single camera is proposed. The system uses the images captured by the camera to verify the water levels of the rivers. The preliminary positions of the current water marks are first identified from the images of the staff gauges installed on site using the basic digital image processing technology. To establish the correct water levels from the preliminary water mark positions, the system uses the image histogram of the staff gauge region of interest to provide a reference for the water-level determination mechanism. The camera position typically results in a nonorthogonal angle between the camera’s optical axis and the on-site staff gauge plane because it causes perspective distortion that eventually leads to deviations. When the water level is low, the distance of the water line deviation from the orthogonal position becomes larger, and the actual distance represented by the pixel also becomes larger, resulting in greater deviations. To address this issue, this system adopts the inverse perspective mapping method to rectify the perspective distortion. By setting the reference water level and control points, this system can accurately calculate water levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed automatic water-level measurement system as applied in confined spaces can reduce the image measurement error caused by the perspective distortion as well as verify and identify the current water levels. ? 2021 Author(s).",,Cameras; Gages; Image coding; Image segmentation; Inverse problems; Level measurement; Light measurement; Optical data processing; Security systems; Space applications; Water levels; Camera positions; Digital image processing technologies; Image histograms; Image measurements; Inverse perspective mappings; Perspective distortion; Region of interest; Surveillance cameras; Water resources,"Kuo, L.-C.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: letmefly99@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111983675

However, the ability to control multicolor lasing characteristics within a small mode volume with high reconfigurability remains challenging. The color gamut is also restricted by the number of dyes and emission wavelength of existing materials. In this study, we introduce a fully programmable multicolor laser by encapsulating organic-dye-doped cholesteric liquid crystal microdroplet lasers in an optofluidic fiber. A mechanism for tuning laser emission wavelengths was proposed by manipulating the topologically induced nanoshell structures in microdroplets with different chiral dopant concentrations.

For energy-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, some relays may lack sufficient energy to forward the buffered packets even their relay-to-destination channels are strong enough, leading to significant performance loss. This work studies buffer-aided relaying for relays that accumulate the energy harvested from source signal using finite-size energy buffers. A relay selection scheme considering both data buffer and energy buffer status is proposed and its performance is theoretically analyzed through Markov-chain modeling. Due to the complex behavior of dual buffers, the power consumption for reporting buffer status is first ignored in the theoretical analysis, which is then extended to, including feedback energy consumption. We validate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and extensively discuss the performance of the proposed relay selection scheme subject to numerous key parameters. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed relay selection scheme can fully exploit the diversity gain of multiple relays when ignoring energy consumption of feedback. With nonnegligible feedback energy consumption, the proposed relay selection scheme still significant outperforms some existing buffer-aided relay selection schemes. ? 2014 IEEE.",Buffer; energy harvesting; Internet of Things (IoT); Markov chain; relay,Energy harvesting; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Markov chains; Telecommunication repeaters; Diversity gain; Energy-constrained; Internet of Things (IOT); Markov chain models; Numerical results; Performance loss; Relay selection; Source signals; Buffer storage,"Liu, K.-H.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: khliu@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100446811

The proposed HESS provides satisfactory power for dynamic movements of EVs (e.g., acceleration or braking) while keeping the battery current within a secure level to prevent it from degradation. The configurations of conventional HESSs are often complex due to the two energy storages and their current/voltage sensing involved. Therefore, in this paper, a simple current-sensing scheme is utilized and the battery is directly treated as a controlled variable to help the battery output current remain stable for different load conditions. While the proposed circuit requires only one current feedback signal, neither the SC nor load current sensors are needed, and the circuit design is thus significantly simplified.

Furthermore, Photoluminescence (PL) spectrum demonstrates a higher blue luminescence (BL) intensity after higher annealing treatment. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum near valence band edge depicts a similar valence band maximum (VBM) characteristic, by means no impact on p-GaN surface bending by using distinct thermal treatment. The device with SiN shows a depletion-mode (D-mode) characteristic (VTH ~ -5 V) whereas the device with SiO2 passivation exhibits an enhancement-mode (E-mode) characteristic (VTH ~ +0.7 V). Moreover, Transmission Line Model (TLM) devices are fabricated to investigate the effects of the passivation on two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in p-GaN/AlGaN/GaN stack.

This paper studied the feasibility of a wearable inertial sensor network (WISN) and its associated shoulder ROM estimation algorithm for shoulder ROM assessment. The WISN composed of three inertial modules were placed on the trunk, upper arm, and forearm of human for assessment of shoulder ROM in real time. Each inertial module consists of an ARM-based 32-bit microcontroller, a triaxial accelerometer, a triaxial gyroscope, a triaxial magnetometer, and a controller area network (CAN) transceiver. The measured accelerations, angular velocities, and magnetic signals generated by the human shoulder movements are transmitted to a personal computer via a Bluetooth wireless transmission module. The proposed shoulder ROM estimation algorithm includes the procedures of data collection, signal preprocessing, quaternion-based orientation estimation, and shoulder joint compensation. In order to evaluate shoulder ROM accurately, accelerations, angular velocities, and magnetic signals are integrated into a quaternion-based complementary nonlinear filter for minimizing the cumulative errors caused by the drift of the inertial sensors. Experimental results demonstrate that the WISN with the designed shoulder ROM estimation algorithm, compared to an optical motion analysis system (Vicon), have the average root mean square (RMS) angle errors ranging from 2.53° to 3.56°. In addition, the intra-tester reliability for each shoulder ROM measurement is excellent. The proposed WISN is a valid and reliable tool and can be used anywhere without any external reference device for convenient evaluation of shoulder ROM. ? 2001-2012 IEEE.",quaternion-based complementary nonlinear filter; Rehabilitation; shoulder range of motion; wearable inertial sensor network,Angular velocity; Control system synthesis; Inertial navigation systems; Personal computers; Sensor networks; Wearable computers; Controller area network; Estimation algorithm; Orientation estimation; Reference devices; Signal preprocessing; Tri-axial magnetometer; Triaxial accelerometer; Wireless transmi-ssion modules; Wearable sensors,"Lin, Y.-C.; Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Taiwan; 電子郵件: richelin@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104600419

Periodic pattern mining is a popular though challenging research field in data mining because periodic patterns are of different types (namely full, inner, and tail patterns) and varied periodicities (namely perfect, imperfect, and asynchronous periodicity). Previous periodic pattern mining methods have some disadvantages: (1) Previous methods have to find different patterns separately; (2) They require postprocessing such as level-by-level join strategies for mining complex periodic patterns which have wildcards between two items. They cannot mine full, tail, and inner periodic patterns with perfect, imperfect, and asynchronous periodicities simultaneously. Therefore, an effective and comprehensive approach capable of discovering the above specified kinds of periodic patterns is needed. We propose a novel suffix tree-based algorithm, Mining dIfferent kinds of Periodic Patterns Simultaneously, MIPPS, to address the above issues. MIPPS finds different kinds of periodic patterns with different periodicities simultaneously without level-by-level join techniques using a novel incremental propagation generator. In addition, MIPPS mines periodic patterns efficiently using some pruning strategies. For the performance evaluation, we use both synthetic and real data to confirm good performance and scalability with complex periodic patterns. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Data mining; Periodic pattern; Periodicity; Symbolic sequence data,Complex networks; DNA sequences; Green computing; Trees (mathematics); Complex-periodic; Performance and scalabilities; Periodic pattern; Protein sequences; Pruning strategy; Real-life applications; Research fields; Synthetic and real data; Data mining,"Huang, J.-W.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: jwhuang@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103612519

By adjusting the bias current and/or body voltage of the REC's input differential pair, the REC offset can be adjusted to a specific voltage equal to a reference voltage referred to henceforth as the embedded reference. For the ADC's coarse stage, RECs with wide-range embedded references are implemented by adjusting the bias currents using current source arrays to cover the full-scale input. By contrast, for the ADC's fine stage, RECs with narrow-range embedded references are implemented by adjusting the body voltage. In addition, the centers of the embedded references in the different ADC subranges are created by current source arrays, which are digitally scaled according to the coarse ADC's output codes. As a result, the reference-voltage-switching network used in conventional subranging ADCs is not required, and hence the speed of the ADC is increased. Moreover, to eliminate the effects of process variation, the bias currents and body voltages in the RECs are calibrated with an auxiliary resistor ladder. After the calibration, the resistor ladder is removed. Consequently, no resistor ladder is used during normal operation, which greatly saves power. A 3 mW 6-bit 4 GS/s REC-based subranging ADC is implemented in 28-nm CMOS technology. With a near Nyquist frequency input, the ADC achieves SNDRs of 31.8 dB and 30.7 dB at 3.6 GS/s and 4 GS/s, respectively.

Same as DCM operation, the control-to-output transfer function of PCCM buck converter exhibits a single pole, which make the transient response faster than that of CCM operation. The most commonly used control for PCCM buck is constant reference current (CRC) control, which needs sensing device to determine the freewheeling time. CRC control suffers from low efficiency under light load condition because of long freewheeling time. The dynamic freewheeling-time (DFT) control for PCCM buck converter is proposed to solve the issue mentioned above. The proposed DFT control uses feedback signal to determine the freewheeling time, which make the freewheeling time vary with load condition at transient state. Thus, the sensing device is needless in DFT control. The proposed DFT control decreases the freewheeling current value under the light load condition. Furthermore, the proposed DFT control can operate in DCM at very light load condition and the freewheeling current is zero. Thus, the light load efficiency of buck converter can be improved.

In this work, we focus on an important nBSS instance, known as hyperspectral unmixing (HU) in remote sensing. HU is a matrix factorization problem aimed at factoring the so-called endmember matrix, holding the material hyperspectral signatures, and the abundance matrix, holding the material fractions at each image pixel. The hyperspectral signatures are usually highly correlated, leading to a fast decay of the singular values (and, hence, high condition number) of the endmember matrix, so HU often introduces an ill-conditioned nBSS scenario. We introduce a new theoretical framework to attack such tough scenarios via the John ellipsoid (JE) in functional analysis. The idea is to identify the maximum volume ellipsoid inscribed in the data convex hull, followed by affinely mapping such ellipsoid into a Euclidean ball. By applying the same affine mapping to the data mixtures, we prove that the endmember matrix associated with the mapped data has condition number 1, the lowest possible, and that these (preconditioned) endmembers form a regular simplex. Exploiting this regular structure, we design a novel nBSS criterion with a provable identifiability guarantee and devise an algorithm to realize the criterion. Moreover, for the first time, the optimization problem for computing JE is exactly solved for a large-scale instance; our solver employs a split augmented Lagrangian shrinkage algorithm with all proximal operators solved by closed-form solutions. The competitiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulations and real data experiments. ? 2012 IEEE.",Condition number; hyperspectral unmixing (HU); John ellipsoid (JE); nonnegative blind source separation (nBSS); regular simplex,Constrained optimization; Factorization; Inverse problems; Mapping; Matrix algebra; Mixtures; Number theory; Numerical methods; Remote sensing; Augmented Lagrangians; Hyperspectral signatures; Hyperspectral unmixing; Ill-conditioned mixtures; Matrix factorizations; Maximum volume ellipsoids; Optimization problems; Theoretical framework; Blind source separation; affine transform; article; blind source separation; computer simulation; conceptual framework; human; remote sensing,"Lin, C.-H.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: chiahsiang.steven.lin@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105599499

Finally, we extend our macro placement methodology to consider dataflow constraint so that dataflow-related macros can be placed at close locations.

Specifically, early identification and triage is required so that patients with chest pain can be quickly sent to a hospital with appropriate care facilities for treatment. In the traditional approach, ambulance personnel often use symptom checklists to examine the patient and make a quick decision for the target hospital. However, not every hospital has specialist facilities to handle such emergency cases. If the result of the subsequent cardiac enzyme test performed at the target hospital strongly suggests the occurrence of myocardial infarction, the patient may need to be sent to another hospital with specialist facilities, such as Percutaneous Coronary Intervention. The standard procedure is time consuming, which may result in delayed treatment and reduce patent survival rate. To resolve this issue, we propose AMBtalk (Ambulance Talk) for accurate, early ACS identification in an ambulance. AMBtalk provides real-time connection to hospital resources, which reduces the elapsed time for treatment, and therefore, improves the patient survival rate. The key to success for AMBtalk is the development of the AllCheck? Internet of Things (IoT) device, which can accurately and quickly provide cardiovascular parameter values for early ACS identification. The interactions between the AllCheck? IoT device, the emergency medical service center, the ambulance personnel and the hospital are achieved through the AMBtalk IoT server in the cloud network. AllCheck? outperforms the existing cardiovascular IoT device solutions for ambulance applications. The testing results of the AllCheck? device show 99% correlation with the results of the hospital reports. Due to its excellent performance in quick ACS identification, the AllCheck? device was awarded the 17th Taiwan Innovators Award in 2020. ? 2021 by the authors.

The 3-D like backside reflector is formed by the deposition of 100 nm-diameter SiO2 nanospheres (NSs) and an Al layer on the sapphire substrate. Based on the use of 45° sidewall and microhole array, the reduced total internal reflection (TIR) and Fresnel reflection and the increased scattering probability and the opportunity of photons to find escape cones can be expected. In addition, the use of 3-D like backside reflector can effectively reflect scatter, and redirect the downward photons emitted from multiple quantum well (MQW) region into arbitrary directions. Thus, the light extraction performance can be substantially improved.

On the superficial layer above the burden of a blast furnace, most of the high-Temperature gas is concentrated near the center, and tracking the position of the hotspot is critical for productivity. However, most of the existing acoustic temperature distribution reconstruction algorithms are developed with relatively uniform temperature distribution environments. Besides, their capabilities of tracking the pinnacle of temperature distribution in the region of interest (ROI) are rarely discussed. In this research, a reconstruction method of acoustic temperature tomography dedicated for highly centralized gas temperature distribution is proposed and demonstrated. The key metrics include the reproducibility of 2-D temperature distribution, the sensitivity of hotspot shift, and the accuracy of point-To-point (P2P)/peak temperature. To optimize the result of each metric, previous approaches of acoustic temperature tomography have been first evaluated. Then, the investigation of effects from the shape and size of meshes is proceeded to improve the performance. After that, a novel method to address convergence issues while using the iterative method is introduced. Consequently, the reconstruction method proposed in this article could effectively visualize the temperature map while hotspot moves to different locations. It could also sense the occurrence of a hotspot (2.56% of ROI) traveled from center to 1% of ROI's diameter. Moreover, a competitive accuracy with 5.89% and 1.46% error at P2P root-mean-square (rms) and peak temperature is achieved, respectively. Finally, a practical acoustic 2-D pyrometer consisted of 12 ultrasonic transducers arranged in a circular pattern with a 1-m width of ROI successfully detected the shift of a hotspot when the displacement of a heater reaches 5 cm. ? 1986-2012 IEEE.",Acoustic temperature tomography; highly centralized temperature distribution; hotspot tracking,Blast furnaces; Electromagnetic wave emission; Image segmentation; Noninvasive medical procedures; Pyrometers; Pyrometry; Steelmaking; Steelmaking furnaces; Temperature distribution; Tomography; Tracking (position); Ultrasonic transducers; Acoustic temperature; Gas temperature distributions; High temperature gas; Noninvasive methods; Reconstruction method; Superficial layers; The region of interest (ROI); Tracking algorithm; Iterative methods,"Pal, S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: elex7402@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103429607

Previous work has established the condition, referred to quasi-degradation (QD) probability, under which NOMA has no performance loss compared to the capacity-achieving dirty paper coding for the two-user case. Existing results assume Rayleigh fading channels without line-of-sight (LOS). In many practical scenarios, the channel LOS component is critical to the link quality where the channel gain follows a Rician distribution instead of a Rayleigh distribution. In this work, we analyze the QD probability over multi-input and single-output (MISO) channels subject to Rician fading. The QD probability heavily depends on the angle between two user channels, which involves a matrix quadratic form in random vectors and a stochastic matrix. With the deterministic LOS component, the distribution of the matrix quadratic form is non-central that dramatically complicates the derivation of the QD probability. To remedy this difficulty, a series of approximations is proposed that yields a closed-form expression for the QD probability over MISO Rician channels. Numerical results are presented to assess the analysis accuracy and get insights into the optimality of NOMA over Rician fading channels. ? 1967-2012 IEEE.",Gamma distribution; multi -input single-output (MISO); non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA); quasi-degradation; rician fading,Fading channels; Number theory; Rayleigh fading; Stochastic systems; Analysis accuracy; Closed-form expression; Dirty paper coding; Rayleigh distributions; Rician distribution; Rician fading channel; Spectral efficiencies; Stochastic matrices; Probability distributions,"Liu, K.-H.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: khliu@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102620399

As the molding coil is developed toward miniaturization, the granules consisting of magnetic powder and organic binder cannot uniformly fill the small space in the coil center column during molding.

The uneven packing problem in the coil center column was effectively solved in this study by applying a screen printing process using high-solid-content magnetic pastes. Bisphenol A epoxy resin has the benefits of excellent mechanical, bonding, electrical, corrosion resistance, low shrinkage and low cost properties. However, the viscosity is too high for use as a binder for high-solid-content magnetic paste. The magnetic paste viscosity can be reduced by substituting some low viscosity reactive diluent (butyl glycidyl ether) for Bisphenol A epoxy resin. It was observed that the relative density and magnetic properties (such as initial permeability, saturation magnetization, and core loss) can be effectively improved by increasing the monomer addition because the monomer acts as a lubricant that helps the magnetic particles rearrange during compaction.

We demonstrate that Taguchi's orthogonal array works correctly. In addition, it was determined that C-V measurement is a reliable way to resolve the CGL mechanisms and predict OLED efficiency directly. Based on the experimental results, it was proven that using the Taguchi's orthogonal array improved the efficiency of the tandem OLED device. The current efficiency increased from 3.56 cd/A to 6.13 cd/A. The results of the C-V measurement were compared with the Taguchi's orthogonal array, and the performance of the device was analyzed based on changes in the trend of the capacitance value.

Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF), usually occurring in male chewers of betel quid, is a premalignant stromal disease characterized by a high malignant transformation rate and high prevalence. Although a relationship between the inhabited microbiome and carcinogenesis has been proposed, no detailed information regarding the oral microbiome of patients with OSF exists; the changes of the salivary microbiome during cancer formation remain unclear. This study compared the salivary microbiomes of male patients with OSCC and a predisposing OSF background (OSCC-OSF group) and those with OSF only (OSF group). The results of high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene indicated that OSF-related carcinogenesis and smoking status significantly contributed to phylogenetic composition variations in the salivary microbiome, leading to considerable reductions in species richness and phylogenetic diversity. The microbiome profile of OSF-related malignancy was associated with increased microbial stochastic fluctuation, which dominated the salivary microbiome assembly and caused species co-occurrence network collapse. Artificial intelligence selection algorithms consistently identified 5 key species in the OSCC-OSF group: Porphyromonas catoniae, Prevotella multisaccharivorax, Prevotella sp. HMT-300, Mitsuokella sp. HMT-131, and Treponema sp. HMT-927. Robust accuracy in predicting oral carcinogenesis was obtained with our exploratory and validation data sets. In functional analysis, the microbiome of the OSCC-OSF group had greater potential for S-adenosyl-l-methionine and norspermidine synthesis but lower potential for l-ornithine and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide synthesis and formaldehyde metabolism. These findings indicated that the salivary microbiome plays important roles in modulating microbial metabolites during oral carcinogenesis.

Unlike existing methods that solve HI directly, this paper explores a different line of attack by transforming HI into another inverse problem, i.e., decoding in hyperspectral compressed sensing (DHCS). Since HI and DHCS both aim to output the complete hyperspectral data, we can solve HI via DHCS, if we are given an effective DHCS method, and if the required input of such DHCS method can be computed from the observable but incomplete image (OII). Computing the required inputs of most DHCS methods is in general very difficult due to the involved randomness of spectrum projection, so the DHCS method considered here is a deterministic one recently developed for satellite remote sensing. The motivation is that though it is hard to recover the complete image from OII, we found that the input of this deterministic DHCS method can be easily computed from OII. This simple idea of inverse problem transform surprisingly yields completive HI performance. ? 2021 IEEE.",compressed sensing; hyperspectral image; image inpainting; Inverse problem; inverse problem transform,Compressed sensing; Hyperspectral imaging; Inverse transforms; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; HyperSpectral; Hyperspectral Data; Inpainting; Satellite remote sensing; Inverse problems,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112805622

The presence of Pt NPs gives the “spill-over” effect and increases the surface area/volume (SA/V) ratio and catalytic activity of the Pt metal. Hence, the related hydrogen sensing performance can be improved.

The inclusion of Al in the HfO2 increased the crystalline temperature (~1000?C) of hafnium aluminate (HfAlOX) and kept the material in the amorphous stage even at very high annealing temperature (&gt;800?C), which subsequently improved the device performance. The gate leakage current (IG) was significantly reduced with the increasing post deposition annealing (PDA) temperature from 300 to 600?C in HfAlOX-based MOS-HEMT, compared to the HfO2-based device. In comparison with HfO2 gate dielectric, the interface state density (Dit ) can be reduced significantly using HfAlOX due to the effective passivation of the dangling bond. The greater band offset of the HfAlOX than HfO2 reduces the tunneling current through the gate dielectric at room temperature (RT), which resulted in the lower IG in Γ-gate HfAlOX MOS-HEMT. Moreover, IG was reduced more than one order of magnitude in HfAlOX MOS-HEMT by the N2 surface plasma treatment, due to reduction of N2 vacancies which were created by ICP dry etching.

Although the GPS system was originally designed for near-Earth navigation, currently it is widely used in highly dynamic environments (such as low Earth orbit (LEO)). A space-capable GPS receiver (GPSR) is capable of providing timing and navigation information for spacecraft to determine the orbit and synchronize the onboard timing; therefore, it is one of the essential components of modern spacecraft. However, a space-grade GPSR is technol-ogy-sensitive and under export control. In order to overcome export control, the National Space Organization (NSPO) in Taiwan completed the development of a self-reliant space-grade GPSR in 2014. The NSPO GPSR, built in-house, has passed its qualification tests and is ready to fly onboard the Triton satellite. In addition to providing navigation, the GPS/global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is facilitated to many remote sensing missions, such as GNSS radio occultation (GNSS-RO) and GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R). Based on the design of the NSPO GPSR, the NSPO is actively engaged in the development of the Triton program (a GNSS reflectometry mission). In a GNSS-R mission, the reflected signals are processed to form delay Doppler maps (DDMs) so that various properties (including ocean surface roughness, vegetation, soil moisture, and so on) can be re-trieved. This paper describes not only the development of the NSPO GPSR but also the design, development, and special features of the Triton’s GNSS-R mission.

However, this approach lacks for intended risk information on the predictors' uncertainty, e.g., weather condition and load variation. This article proposes a novel statistical load forecasting (SLF) using quantile regression random forest (QRRF), probability map, and risk assessment index (RAI) to obtain the actual pictorial of the outcome risk of load demand profile. To know the actual load condition, the proposed SLF is built considering accurate point forecasting results, and the QRRF establishes the PI from various quantiles. To correlate the uncertainty of external factors to the actual load, the probability map computes the most probable quantile happening in the training horizon. Based on the current inputs, the RAI calculates the PI's intended risk. The proposed SLF is verified by Independent System Operator-New England data, compared to benchmark algorithms and Winkler score. The results show that the proposed method can model a more precise load PI along with the risk evaluation, as compared to results of the existing benchmark models. ? 2020 IEEE.",discrete wavelet transforms; quantile regression; short-term load forecasting; Statistical load forecasting; whale optimization algorithm,Decision trees; Electric power plant loads; Electric utilities; Probability density function; Random forests; Risk assessment; Stochastic systems; Assessment index; External factors; Independent system operators; Prediction interval; Probability maps; Quantile regression; Risk information; Stochastic loads; Forecasting,"Yang, H.-T.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: htyang@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102007377

The pivotal point of this work is to reduce electrical variations in ferroelectric capacitors, which we attribute to the random variation in ferroelectric and dielectric phases. The motivation for this research originally stemmed from Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov's theory of nucleation, which predicts that a sufficient time is required for forming any particular phase during phase transformation. Instead of increasing the temperature beyond 700 °C, extending the duration of rapid thermal annealing allows uniform crystal to form, which agrees with the theory. A 10 nm thick Hf1-xZrxO2 film (x = 0.2) has been fabricated. The duration and temperature of rapid thermal annealing (RTA) under a nitrogen (N2) atmosphere at 1 atmospheric pressure (atm) is varied to observe its effect on crystal formation and the electrical properties of the devices. It was observed that very low temperature and short (30 s) duration annealing at 1 atm pressure cannot infuse ferroelectricity in Hf1-xZrxO2. Structural analysis clearly showed the formation of large and uniform ferroelectric domains with negligible impact on surface roughness upon extending the annealing duration up to 180 s. The device-to-device variation in terms of standard deviation of coercive voltage and peak capacitance are reduced from 400 to 17 mV and from 20 to 4 fF/cm2, respectively, by increasing the RTA duration at 700 °C. The devices have also displayed endurance above 1 million cycles and leakage current density below 10 pA/μm2. The simple physics-based process discussed here reduces the thermal budget required for Hf1-xZrxO2, mitigates the randomness in the domain distribution, and infuses deterministic switching. This improvement paves the way for implementing Hf1-xZrxO2-based, deeply scaled ferroelectric devices for memory and steep slope device applications. ? 2021 American Chemical Society.",endurance; ferroelectric; HfO2; leakage; rapid thermal annealing; variability,Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Budget control; Capacitance; Computational complexity; Crystals; Ferroelectric devices; Ferroelectric films; Ferroelectricity; Hafnium oxides; Oxide films; Oxides; Rapid thermal processing; Surface roughness; Thermal Engineering; Voltage measurement; Zirconium compounds; Electrical variations; Ferroelectric capacitors; Ferroelectric domains; Ferroelectric grains; Johnson-mehl-avrami-kolmogorov; Rapid thermal annealing (RTA); Variability reduction; Very low temperatures; Rapid thermal annealing,"Lu, D.D.; Institute of Microelectronics, Taiwan; 電子郵件: darsenlu@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100641556

Previous studies have shown that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has enabled the assessment of AD progression based on imaging findings. The present work aimed to establish an algorithm based on three features, namely, volume, surface area, and surface curvature within the hippocampal subfields, to model variations, including atrophy and structural changes to the cortical surface. In this study, a new biomarker, the ratio of principal curvatures (RPC), was proposed to characterize the folding patterns of the cortical gyrus and sulcus. Along with volumes and surface areas, these morphological features associated with the hippocampal subfields were assessed in terms of their sensitivity to the changes in cognitive capacity by two different feature selection methods. Either the extracted features were statistically significantly different, or the features were selected through a random forest model. The identified subfields and their structural indices that are sensitive to the changes characteristic of the progression from MCI to AD were further assessed with a multilayer perceptron classifier to help facilitate the diagnosis. The accuracy of the classification based on the proposed method to distinguish whether a MCI patient enters the AD stage amounted to 79.95%, solely using the information from the features selected by a logical feature selection method. ?

To motivate the mobile users to transmit data over the cellular/WiFi networks under the control of the operator smartly, many incentive pricing frameworks have been proposed with the execution of dynamic bandwidth reallocation schemes to improve network efficiency. In this paper, a Satisfaction-based Dynamic Bandwidth Reallocation (SDBR) scheme is proposed to improve user satisfaction in term of the blocking probability and the user payment in data offloading environments. In SDBR, the operator can efficiently reallocate the bandwidth to accommodate more potential users; the overall operator revenue therefore increases as well. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SDBR scheme, we first assess the blocking probability with and without serving users having WiFi connections and discuss the benefits of the dynamic bandwidth allocation. Then, we elaborate a satisfaction-based pricing scheme for data downloading to motivate both mobile operator and users to work with SDBR, which brings the increment of operator overall revenue and reduction of individual user payment. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed SDBR scheme outperforms the four existing bandwidth allocation schemes in both time-based and volume-based data transmission. ? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",LTE; MPTCP; Payment; User satisfaction; WiFi offloading,Blocking probability; Costs; Economics; Frequency allocation; Wi-Fi; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Bandwidth allocation scheme; Dynamic bandwidth; Dynamic bandwidth allocation; Heavy traffic load; Mobile data offloading; Network efficiency; User satisfaction; Wi-Fi connections; Bandwidth,"Sou, S.-I.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: sisou@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85095581538

However, the large number of EVs connected to a power grid with a large power demand and uncertainty may result in significant challenges for a power system. In this study, the optimal charging and discharging scheduling strategies of G2V/V2G and battery energy storage system (BESS) were proposed for EV charging stations. A distributed computation architecture was employed to streamline the complexity of an optimization problem. By considering EV charging/discharging conversion efficiencies for different load conditions, the proposed method was used to maximize the operational profits of each EV and BESS based on the related electricity tariff and demand response programs. Moreover, the behavior model of drivers and cost of BESS degradation caused by charging and discharging cycles were considered to improve the overall practical applicability. An EV charging station with 100 charging piles was simulated as an example to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The developed algorithms can be used for EV charging stations, load aggregators, and service companies integrated with distributed energy resources in a smart grid. ? 2021 by the authors.

FeSiCr alloy powders (FSC) with a large particle size were mixed with fine spherical carbonyl iron powder to increase the compaction density. FSC to carbonyl iron powder (CIP) mixing ratio effects on magnetic paste rheological behaviors and magnetic properties of the molding coil prepared using screen printing were investigated. A magnetic paste with the lowest viscosity can be obtained using 3C7F (30% CIP + 70% FSC) due to the small-sized CIP adsorbed onto the FSC surface. This process reduces the interlocked network formation resulting from the CIP. The toroidal core with 3C7F exhibited the highest relative density and highest inductance. The coils with pure CIP and higher CIP content exhibited the better DC superposition characteristic. The toroidal core loss increased rapidly as the FSC content was increased. A proper trade-off between the inductance, DC-bias superposition characteristic, and magnetic core loss can be reached by choosing a suitable powder mixing ratio. ? 2021 by the authors.

Directly training SNN with backpropagation has already shown competitive accuracy compared with Deep Neural Networks. Besides the accuracy, the number of spikes per inference has a direct impact on the processing time and energy once employed in the neuromorphic processors. However, previous direct-training algorithms do not put great emphasis on this metric. Therefore, this paper proposes four enhancing schemes for the existing direct-training algorithm, Spatio-Temporal Back-Propagation (STBP), to improve not only the accuracy but also the spike count per inference. We first modify the reset mechanism of the spiking neuron model to address the information loss issue, which enables the firing threshold to be a trainable variable. Then we propose two novel output spike decoding schemes to effectively utilize the spatio-temporal information. Finally, we reformulate the derivative approximation of the non-differentiable firing function to simplify the computation of STBP without accuracy loss. In this way, we can achieve higher accuracy and lower spike count per inference on image classification tasks. Moreover, the enhanced STBP is feasible for the on-line learning hardware implementation in the future. ? 2021 EDAA.",artificial intelligence (AI); backpropagation; direct-training algorithm; image classification; machine learning; neuromorphic computing; spiking neural network (SNN),Backpropagation; Deep neural networks; Energy efficiency; Inference engines; Hardware implementations; Information loss; Neuromorphic hardwares; Non-differentiable; Spatiotemporal information; Spiking neural networks; Spiking neuron models; Training algorithms; Neural networks,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111041768

An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with a genetic algorithm (GA) with several spatiotemporal indexes from contour analysis of 3DPIs was proposed in order to investigate the taut level of a string-like pulse. Methods: Forty-eight pulse image patterns and 283 2DPIs were obtained before and after a cold pressor test (CPT). The 3DPI and two-dimensional pulse image (2DPI) were constructed successively via spline interpolation. The improved contour analysis of pulse images was to elucidate three indexes from 2DPI at the contour level 0.8: the longitudinal diameter (2DL), the transverse diameter (2DT), and the area of contours. These indexes were adapted to ANFIS-GA system, whereas the output was taut level value α. Results: α can reflect the taut level of string-like pulse. The ANFIS-GA provides a pattern and system to analyze taut level of string-like pulse. Conclusions: CPT increases arterial stiffness to make pulse image tauter.

This article is motivated because some existent magnetron-driven systems often adopted two resonant circuits individually for filament heating and cavity driving, resulting in limited flexibility of power delivery and modulation. Therefore, this article develops an integrated resonant power circuit that excels at the capability improvement of filament heating and cavity driving in the same time such that the design process and power conversion can be simplified while the output power is effectively induced. Meanwhile, by considering that the microwave source emission in the magnetron is often affected by the variation of internal impedance, this article includes a gain-frequency tracking control. Through this way of controller design, both heating power and cavity power are found to be well regulated and the constant-power operation can be better achieved. To confirm the effectiveness of this magnetron-driven design, both circuit simulation and hardware realization are accomplished. Analysis results and experimental outcome support the practicality of the approach, benefiting the realization of microwave energy applications. ? 1986-2012 IEEE.",Frequency regulation; integrated resonant circuit; magnetron,Circuit simulation; Controllers; Electric power transmission; Heating; Magnetrons; Timing circuits; Capability improvement; Controller designs; Filament heating; Gain frequencies; Hardware realization; Internal impedance; Microwave energies; Microwave sources; Resonant circuits,"Huang, S.-J.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: clhuang@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092742766

Lissamine rhodamine B-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanol was incorporated into the liposome bilayer to provide the nanovesicles with fluorescence without any encapsulants, which not only made the liposome fabrication much easier without the need for purification but also improved the chip-probing quality. A special chip assay was washed very gently without the traditional spin-dry step. Forty-five PI5P-interacting proteins were identified in triplicate with this special chip assay. Subsequently, we used flow cytometry to validate these interactions, and a total of 41 PI5P-interacting proteins were confirmed. Enrichment analysis revealed that these proteins have significant functions associated with ribosome biogenesis, rRNA processing, ribosome binding, GTP binding, and hydrolase activity. Their component enrichment is located in the nucleolus. The InterPro domain analysis indicated that PI5P-interacting proteins are enriched in the P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases domain (P-loop). Additionally, using the MEME program, we identified a consensus motif (IVGPAGTGKSTLF) that contains the Walker A sequence, a well-known nucleotide-binding motif.

As frequency-sensitive features usually possess multi-variable and high-correlated characteristics, this paper employed an ensemble learning technique (the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree algorithm, GBDT) to construct Frequency Response Model (FRM) of the Taipower system in Taiwan to evaluate by CPS1 score. The proposed CPS1 model was then integrated with Unit Commitment (UC) program to determine the unit-dispatch that achieves the targeted CPS1 score.

Recently deep learning models introduced hierarchical temporal feature engineering and context information for Spatio-Temporal tasks, and thus this study geared to exploit the advantages of deep learning models, specially, in the form of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, variants of RNN models, and adaptive hybrid networks combining gated recurrent units (GRU) and CNN for the time-series tasks.

The q-d axis equivalent-circuit model is derived to establish the complete system model under three-phase balanced condition. A lead-lag power oscillation damping controller (PODC) for modulating the rotor's external resistance of the studied wind DSIG is designed by using phase-compensation method to improve the damping of the wind DSIG under different operating conditions. The geometric measure of observability is also employed to select a suitable feedback signal for the designed PODC. A systematic method using a frequency-domain approach based on eigenvalue analysis and a time-domain approach based on nonlinear-model simulations are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme and the designed PODC. It can be concluded from the simulation results that the rotor's external resistance joined with the designed PODC is capable of improving damping of the studied wind DSIG under different operating conditions. ? 2021 IEEE.,Dynamic-slip induction generator; Geometric measure of observability; Phase-compensation method; Power oscillation damping controller; Rotor's external resistance; Stability; Wind-turbine generator,Damping; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Equivalent circuits; Frequency domain analysis; Geometry; Observability; Power control; Signal analysis; Time domain analysis; Turbogenerators; Wind turbines; Compensation method; Dynamic slips; Dynamic-slip induction generator; External resistance; Geometric measure of observability; Geometric measures; Phase compensation; Phase-compensation method; Power oscillation damping controllers; Rotor external resistance; Wind turbine generators; Asynchronous generators,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124689168

To quickly obtain a better placement at an early stage, engineers often reference dataflow of a design to determine the relative locations of cells and macros. To achieve this target, this paper presents two methods to make a placement follow this constraint. First, we give larger weights to those nets which connect to datapath-oriented objects in the beginning, and then gradually shrink the values by the modified Gompertz curve according to the status of placement utilization in order to shorten their distances without interfering with object distribution. Second, we define desirable placement regions for each datapath-oriented object and propose a novel sigmoid function to give additional penalties to these objects in the analytical placement formulation if they are not in the regions. The experiment demonstrates that our methodology can obtain better results than the other approach which does not consider dataflow constraint. Not only wirelength but also routability will be improved in the resulting placement. Furthermore, our placer outperforms the RTL-aware dataflow-driven macro placer. ? 2021 IEEE",,Computer aided design; Integrated circuit manufacture; Analytical Placement; Circuit designs; Data paths; Dataflow; Mixed Size; Object distribution; Placement algorithm; Relative location; Sigmoid function; Wire length; Timing circuits,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124171356

Routing overflow may come from global and local routing congestion in a placement. To target on resolving these problems, this paper proposes two techniques in a global placement algorithm based on an analytical placement formulation and the multilevel framework. To remove global routing congestion, we consider each net as a movable soft module and propose a novel congestion-aware net penalty model so that a net will receive a larger penalty if it covers more routing congested regions. Therefore, our placement formulation can be more easier to move nets away from routing congested regions than other approaches and has less impact on wirelength. In addition, to relieve local congestion, we propose an inflation technique to expand the area of a cluster according to its internal connectivity intensity and routing congestion occupied by the cluster. The experimental results demonstrate that our approaches can get better routability and wirelength compared to other approaches such as NTUplace4h, NTUplace4dr, and RePlAce. ?2021 IEEE",,Cell placement; Global placements; Global routing; Local routing; Placement algorithm; Routability; Routing congestion; Routings; VLSI design; Wire length; VLSI circuits,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124161336

The linear cyclic pursuit protocol suffers from the robustness problem due to the rotation angle of the line of sight between the agents, as a small perturbation in the rotation angle can cause the system to become structurally unstable, which makes the overall system either stable or unstable. To maintain a geometric pattern the linear system should maintain its marginal stability. To address this issue, individual agents connected via cyclic protocol are modeled to behave like Hopf oscillators. Consequently, two control laws are introduced based on Hopf oscillators, one with a static target at the origin and other with a virtual circular moving target. With a static target we show that it is possible to utilize the coupling gain to render geometric patterns and with a virtual target we can render geometric patterns inherently with the amplitude and frequency parameters of the virtual target along with rotation angle flexibility. For both the cases we utilize Poincar? map to show the existence of trochoidal like quasi-periodic trajectories. ? 2021 IEEE",Cyclic pursuit; Hopf oscillator; Limit cycle; Poincar? map; Quasiperiodicity; Trochoid-like patterns,Geometry; Rotation; Cyclic pursuit; Geometric patterns; Hopf oscillator; Limit-cycle; Oscillator dynamics; Poincare map; Quasi-periodicities; Rotation angles; Trochoid-like pattern; Virtual target; Linear systems,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123955272

The RAIM is conducted by using the redundancy of several ranging measurements from the multi-constellation navigation system, performing a voting mechanism to exclude the outliers and fault ranging measurements. The conventional RAIM algorithm for achieving the fault detection and isolation is carried out using the stand-alone GNSS. In this study, the signal of the opportunity from a ground positioning radio is further considered, such as fusing ground-based Ultra Wide Band (UWB) positioning measurements. In addition, an alternative RAIM with a Model Uncertainty (MU) is applied. In this manner, a higher performance and robustness can be obtained.

In particular, the use of GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) in probing sea surface height, wind velocity, salinity, soil moisture, roughness, and snow depth has been realized in several space mission. The TRITON mission from Taiwan is one GNSS-R mission under planning. A key step in onboard GNSS-R signal processing is the determination of the specular reflection point. With the information of the specular reflection point, the GNSS-R processing unit can estimate the propagation delay between the direct line-of-sight signal and the reflected signal so that the correlation processing within the GNSS-R processing unit can be appropriately adjusted. In prior work, the specular reflection point on the spherical Earth is computed by solving a quartic polynomial equation. To deal with ellipsoidal Earth model, an iterative algorithm is often used. To our knowledge, an explicit characterization of the specular reflection point on the ellipsoidal Earth has not been developed. In this paper, an analytic approach is developed to determine the specular reflection point on the ellipsoidal Earth. By exploiting the Snells law and minimal distance property, a sextic polynomial equation is obtained that characterizes the specular reflection point. This leads to an analytic approach in solving the specular reflection point that is not subject to initial condition uncertainty and iteration complexity. To account for the error in the determination of the specular reflection point, two metrics are proposed to depict the dilution of precision with respect to errors of the positions of the transmitter and receiver. Moreover, error ellipse on the surface can be established for the assessment of the accuracy in the determination of the specular reflection point. The results can be used on-board a spaceborne mission with bounded computational load and assured quality. ? 2021 IEEE.",GNSS; reflectometry; specular reflection point; TRITON,Errors; Global positioning system; Iterative methods; Polynomials; Reflectometers; Remote sensing; Satellites; Signal processing; Soil moisture; Space optics; Surface waters; Analytic approach; Global Navigation Satellite Systems; Polynomials equation; Processing units; Reflection points; Reflectometry; Remote sensing monitoring; Specular reflection point; Specular reflections; TRITON; Reflection,"Juang, J.-C.; National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan",English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123621116

The distance corresponded to every frequency can be detected if the targets in the same range bin has different Doppler frequencies. Therefore, the fundamental theoretical limit of range resolution can be broken through applying the proposed waveform.

Therefore, in this paper, an innovative method is proposed to implement the AL more intuitively and freely. Through switching two adjacent focal points rapidly, it is possible to generate an acoustic trap with low-density sound field on specific position. The object would be hold in this trap and could be moved by changing the position of the trap. In this paper, serval acoustic levitating experiments have been conducted to verify the proposed method. Besides, acoustic field simulation was also performed to visualize and quantify the presence of acoustic trap. The experimental results including levitating one object, two object, and transportation of a single target have proved the levitating capability of the proposed method.

We aim to design 1-b spatial equalization matrix coefficients that minimize the postequalization mean squared error that leads to a nonconvex problem. Known solutions based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and forward&#x2013;backward splitting (FBS) are proposed to solve the 1-b spatial equalization matrix design problem. The SDR-based algorithm can achieve excellent bit error rate (BER) performance. However, its high complexity limits its use in large-scale system configurations. The FBS-based algorithm contains several predetermined tuning parameters that are scenario-dependent and nontrivial to obtain. Moreover, the performance of the FBS-based algorithm still requires improvement. On the basis of these considerations, we propose two algorithms for solving the 1-b spatial equalization matrix design problem. The first algorithm reduces the performance gap between the unquantized linear minimum mean squared error equalizer and the 1-b SDR-assisted equalizer while maintaining a reasonable complexity; the second algorithm balances the tradeoff between complexity and performance. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can achieve excellent BER performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Charging scheduling of an electric vehicle for time- and cost-efficiency depends on many variables in a dynamic environment, such as the time-of-use price and the availability of charging piles at a charging station. This paper presents an adaptive charging scheduling strategy that accounts for the uncertainty in the charging price and the availability of charging stations. We consider the charging scheduling of an electric vehicle in consideration of these variables. We develop a Multiagent Rainbow Deep Q Network with Imparting Preference where the two agents select a charging station and determine the charging quantity. An imparting preference technique is introduced to share experience and learn the charging scheduling strategy for the vehicle en route. Real-world data is used to simulate the vehicle and to learn the charging scheduling. The performance of the model is compared against two reinforcement learning-based benchmarks and a human-imitative charging scheduling strategy on four scenarios.

The imaging process is remodeled as a transmit-receive wireless communication paradigm in a novel approach for correcting space- and time-varying blur in stellar images. In particular, the effect of starlight passing through atmospheric turbulence is modeled as multipath fading communication channels. The problem is then transformed into channel equalization in space and time domains to produce a sharp stellar image. This approach involves first estimating the center of a blurred stellar image. Next, linear regression obtains an equivalent two-dimensional channel response through decomposition of the blurred image into the weighted sum of the diffraction-limited patterns in the spatial domain. Finally, an alignment algorithm is implemented for synthesis, and a final output is generated.

However, under EDCA, all video data are allocated to the same access category (AC) queue, irrespective of their coding importance. Consequently, the quality of the transmitted video may be severely degraded under heavy traffic load conditions. The literature contains several queue mapping mechanisms based on the settings of the AC queues, such as contention window size, for improving the video transmission quality over IEEE 802.11e WLANs. However, these mechanisms fail to consider the effect of the dequeuing time on the video delivery performance. Accordingly, the present study proposes a new queue mapping algorithm, designated as the throughput-based mapping algorithm (TMA), for improving the video transmission quality and reducing the video delay by dynamically allocating the video data packets to different AC queues based on their length and throughput such that the probability of the dequeuing time being reduced is increased. In implementing the proposed approach, the throughputs of the AC queues are analyzed using two Markov chain models.

One of them is the adaptive cruise control (ACC) system. The ACC system is a continuation of research on cruise control (CC) system, which integrates spacing control with the existing velocity control on the CC system. The vehicles with an ACC system guarantee traffic safety while at the same time ensure a well-driving sense. Many studies have demonstrated numerous control techniques applied as ACC controllers to accomplish uncertainty and perturbation issues. Nevertheless, most of the existing papers assumed the model vehicle dynamics as a linear time-invariant (LTI) system while designing the ACC controller. This paper proposed an ACC controller using the gain scheduling technique to deal with the model vehicle dynamics as a linear parameter varying (LPV) system. The passenger vehicle&#x2019;s mass varies during ACC operation depending on how many passengers or loads on the vehicle&#x2019;s trunks. Later, the vehicle&#x2019;s mass is estimated by recursive least square (RLS) with a forgetting factor. Then, the disk margin is utilized to provide the high-level robustness at each operating or &#x201C;frozen&#x201D; point. The robustness performance will be analyzed using the worst-case gain metric while the uncertainty is modeled by integral quadratic constraints (IQC). The LPV system behavior, such as the rate vehicle&#x2019;s mass, is also considered in the analysis. The effectiveness algorithm is validated through joint simulation between Matlab/Simulink and PreScan. The last, the comparison performance between gain scheduling and fixed gain ACC controller is evaluated.

Our verification system is composed of two stages. The first stage is an arbitrarily axis-aligned object detector, which is mainly based on a deep residual network and feature pyramid network (FPN). The detector predicts the rotation bounding boxes for drugs using multiscale feature maps generated by the FPN. Then, the rotation bounding boxes are axially aligned, and the drug image is cropped according to the axis-aligned bounding box. The second stage is a feature matcher, which is based on a feature embedding network. The embedding feature extracted by the feature embedding network is combined with the geometric feature obtained by the arbitrarily axis-aligned object detector to determine whether the drug in the image belongs to the category specified by the user. The database used in this research is an image database created by imaging drugs provided by domestic local medical centers.

PIs have important regulatory functions in the cell including lipid signaling, protein transport, and membrane trafficking.

Besides, the complete PI-binding spectrum and potential PI-binding domains have not been interlinked. No comprehensive databases are available to support the lipid-protein interaction research on phosphoinositides. Here we constructed the first knowledgebase of Yeast Phosphoinositide-Binding Proteins (YPIBP), a repository consisting of 679 PI-binding proteins collected from high-throughput proteome-array and lipid-array studies, QuickGO, and a rigorous literature mining. The YPIBP also contains protein domain information in categories of lipid-binding domains, lipid-related domains and other domains. The YPIBP provides search and browse modes along with two enrichment analyses (PI-binding enrichment analysis and domain enrichment analysis). An interactive visualization is given to summarize the PI-domain-protein interactome. Finally, three case studies were given to demonstrate the utility of YPIBP.

It aims to study and accommodate three typical traffic types: enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC), and massive machine-type communications (mMTC) in optimal path selection. The proposed framework is able to dynamically allocate network resources to corresponding traffic of above types for satisfying the requirements of each identified flow, using a multi-level queue management mechanism to alleviate the flow dropping problem when the network becomes congested. For experiment and verification, a testbed platform was built to evaluate the functionalities of developed modules, the performance of the diffserv-based optimal path selection, and the operation of multi-level queue management.

While many repositories tried to add insights into the raw data in TCGA, no existing database provides both comprehensive gene-level and isoform-level cancer stage marker investigation and survival analysis. We constructed Cancer DEIso to facilitate in-depth analyses for both gene-level and isoform-level human cancer studies. Patient RNA-seq data, sample sheets, patient clinical data, and human genome datasets were collected and processed in Cancer DEIso. And four functions to search differentially expressed genes/isoforms between cancer stages were implemented: (i) Search potential gene/isoform markers for a specified cancer type and its two stages; (ii) Search potentially induced cancer types and stages for a gene/isoform; (iii) Expression survival analysis on a given gene/isoform for some cancer; (iv) Gene/isoform stage expression comparison visualization.

The switching uniformity and the endurance of memory window are both improved by the effective bilayer modulation. Through experimental data and ab-initio calculation, both the switching and modulation mechanisms are clarified. The effective modulation can be attributed to the multiple thin conductive filaments with dual vacancies within the bilayer stacks of the multilayer hBN and titanium oxide.

By exploiting the special structures of the correlation matrix and the staggered property of the FBMC/OQAM signals, we obtain an efficient method of computing the DFE coefficients that requires a smaller number of multiplications than the linear equalizer (LE) and conventional DFE do.

For systems equipped with RGB-D sensors, the corresponding transformation between frames can be effectively estimated using the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithms. Edge points, which cover most of the geometric structures in a frame, are good candidates for control points in ICP. However, the depth of object contour points is hard to accurately measure using commercial RGB-D sensors. Inspired by the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm, this work proposes a meta-ICP algorithm to jointly estimate the optimal transformation for multiple tasks, which are constructed by sampled datapoints. To increase task sampling efficiency, an edge-based task set partition algorithm is introduced for constructing complementary task sets. Moreover, to prevent ICP from being trapped in local minima, a dynamic model adaptation scheme is adopted to disturb the trapped tasks. Experimental results reveal that the probability of unstable estimations can be effectively reduced, indicating a much narrower error distribution of repeated experiments when adopting re-sampled points. With the proposed scheme, the overall absolute trajectory error can be improved by more than 30% as compared to the related edge-based methods using frame-to-frame pose estimation. ? 2013 IEEE.",Camera pose estimation; iterative closest point; model-agnostic meta-learning,Augmented reality; Cameras; Image registration; Probability distributions; 3D surface reconstruction; Augmented reality applications; Camera pose estimation; Error distributions; Geometric structure; Iterative closest point algorithm; Optimal transformation; Sampling efficiency; Iterative methods,"Shieh, M.-D.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: shiehm@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112479718

IVS-Caffe can simulate the hardware behavior of convolution neural network inference calculation. It can quantize weights, input, and output features of convolutional neural network (CNN) and simulate the behavior of multipliers and accumulators calculation to achieve the bit-accurate result. Furthermore, it can test the accuracy of the chosen CNN hardware accelerator. Besides, this article proposes an algorithm to solve the deviation of gradient backpropagation in the bit-accurate quantized multipliers and accumulators. This allows the training of a bit-accurate model and further increases the accuracy of the CNN model at user-designed bit width. The proposed tool takes Faster region based CNN (R-CNN) + Matthew D. Zeiler and Rob Fergus (ZF)-Net, Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) + VGG, SSD + MobileNet, and Tiny you only look once (YOLO) v2 as the experimental models. These models include both one-stage object detection and two-stage object detection models, and base networks include the convolution layer, the fully connected layer, and the modern advanced layers, such as the inception module and depthwise separable convolution. In these experiments, direct quantization of layer-I/O fixed-point models to bit-accurate models will have a 2&#x0025; mean average precision (mAP) drop of accuracy in the constraint that all layers' accumulators and multipliers are quantized to less or equal to 14 and 12 bit, respectively. After retraining of these quantized models with the proposed IVS-Caffe, we can achieve less than 1&#x0025; mAP drop in accuracy in the constraint that all layers' accumulators and multipliers are quantized to less or equal to 14 and 11 bit, respectively. With the proposed IVS-Caffe, we can analyze the accuracy of the target model when it is running at hardware accelerators with different bit widths, which is beneficial to fine-tune the target model or customize the hardware accelerators with lower power consumption.

In this paper, efficient methods to estimate test pattern counts for an extensive range of input/output counts are developed. These methods require only a small number of ATPG runs. The estimation results can then be utilized to determine the test data volume for each input/output configuration. The configuration with the estimated lowest test data volume thus can be determined.

Recently, frequency nadir prediction has become more challenging because renewables have penetrated and significantly changed the generation portfolio within the system. Conventionally, the frequency nadir is determined using a frequency response model where the features - load damping, system inertia, and effective governor response - are assumed to be known. However, these key features are not easily obtained in a power system that continuously changes during daily operation. This study proposes a supervised learning scheme that traces these key features. It also proposes a new feature - the power gap rate - that better reflects the influence of the load on the system frequency than that of the load damping. Feature importance recognition and the construction of a frequency nadir model (FNM) are realized using the proposed supervised learning scheme. The proposed FNM achieved 54% higher accuracy than the conventional method. Finally, the FNM is implemented in a planning process that quantifies the capacity of the fast responsive reserve (FRR). In two renewable penetration cases, the proposed FRR procurement successfully secured the frequency nadir above the security criterion. ? 2013 IEEE.",Fast responsive reserve; Frequency nadir; Primary frequency response; Supervised learning,Damping; Frequency response; Ancillary service markets; Conventional methods; Frequency security; Generation portfolios; Planning process; Power system operators; Security criterion; System frequency; Supervised learning,"Chang-Chien, L.-R.; Department of Electrical Engineering, East District, Taiwan; 電子郵件: leren@ee.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110886841

The proposed method can accurately estimate rotor position by mitigating the dependence on quality of the magnitude and phase angle of the estimated stator flux linkage. A high-accuracy load angle calculation based on $d$ - $q$ -axis current estimation method is first developed for further rotor position determination. In the rotor position calculation, the reference flux linkage magnitude is used instead of the estimated one to avoid the influence of potential high noise levels during low speed operation. As a result, the rotor angle estimation depends only on the phase angle of stator flux linkage, without the effect of its magnitude. The estimation accuracy can thus be improved. Also, by employing a simple stator flux linkage phase lag compensator, the performance of the proposed sensorless method can be dramatically improved at low speed. Moreover, the problem of motor parameter variation (e.g., changes in winding resistance, stator inductances, and permanent magnetic flux linkage) has been analyzed and overcome. Finally, comparisons between conventional and proposed methods are presented with simulations and experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method. ? 2013 IEEE.",Current estimation; Field-oriented control; Load angle estimation; Permanent magnet motor drive; Rotor position estimation; Sensorless; Sensorless vector control,Electric resistance; Permanent magnets; Position measurement; Stators; Vector control (Electric machinery); Low speed operation; Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor; Permanent magnet synchronous motor drives; Permanent magnetics; Rotor position estimation; Sensor-less techniques; Sensorless field oriented control; Winding resistances; Synchronous motors,"Hsieh, M.-F.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: mfhsieh@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110792434

Using the concept of aggregate plaintext, this paper explores how to optimize the compare-and-swap operation, commonly used for sorting and searching in cloud computing, for FHE data. The resulting performance is optimized by properly arranging the operand locations, corresponding to the desired plaintext slots, and then scheduling a sequence of fundamental homomorphic operations designed to accomplish the targeted operation. Moreover, the hypercube plaintext slot structure is considered to efficiently manipulate the required shift operation and merge multiple operands in an aggregate plaintext. Analytical results show that the number of homomorphic multiplication and shift operations needed in the proposed compare-and-swap operation are logn + 4 and 2logn + 1, respectively, for n-bit data, which is at least 16 times faster than related works for n = 64. Applying the proposed scheme can not only reduce the size of required FHE data, but also improve the total computation time of the chosen operation. ? 2021 IEEE",Aggregate plaintext; Compare-and-swap operation; Fully homomorphic encryption,Aggregates; Cloud computing; Analytical results; Compare and swaps; Fully homomorphic encryption; Homomorphic operations; Shift operations; Slot structures; Sorting and searching; Total computation time; Cryptography,"Shieh, M.-D.; Department of Electrical Engineering, No.1, University Road, Taiwan; 電子郵件: shiehm@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85109005472

A ultraviolet-ozone (UV/O3) surface treatment was done prior to gate dielectric deposition to produce a thin gallium oxynitride (GaOXNY) layer at GaN/oxide interface, which correspondingly acts as a charge trapping layer, resulting in the reduction in VP. The capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements revealed that the traps contributing to the significant positive shifting of VTH had a density of 5.7 × 1012 cm-2.

Dysregulation of translation results in abnormal cell physiology and leads to diseases. Ribosome profiling (RP), also called ribo-seq, is a powerful experimental technique to study translational regulation. It can capture a snapshot of translation by deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments. Many ribosome profiling data processing tools have been developed. However, almost all tools analyze ribosome profiling data at the gene level. Since different isoforms of a gene may produce different proteins with distinct biological functions, it is advantageous to analyze ribosome profiling data at the isoform level. To meet this need, previously we developed a pipeline to analyze 610 public human ribosome profiling data at the isoform level and constructed HRPDviewer database. Results: To allow other researchers to use our pipeline as well, here we implement our pipeline as an easy-to-use software tool called RPiso. Compared to Ribomap (a widely used tool which provides isoform-level ribosome profiling analyses), our RPiso (1) estimates isoform abundance more accurately, (2) supports analyses on more species, and (3) provides a web-based viewer for interactively visualizing ribosome profiling data on the selected mRNA isoforms. Conclusions: In this study, we developed RPiso software tool (http://cosbi7.ee.ncku.edu.tw/RPiso/) to provide isoform-level ribosome profiling analyses. RPiso is very easy to install and execute. RPiso also provides a web-based viewer for interactively visualizing ribosome profiling data on the selected mRNA isoforms. We believe that RPiso is a useful tool for researchers to analyze and visualize their own ribosome profiling data at the isoform level. ? 2021, The Author(s).",Isoform-level; Pipeline; Ribo-seq; Ribosome profiling; Software; Tool; Visualization,"Computer software; Cytology; Data handling; Gene expression; Gene expression regulation; Physiology; Pipelines; Websites; Biological functions; Cell physiology; Experimental techniques; Gene levels; Isoforms; Processing tools; Translational regulation; Web based; Macromolecules; isoprotein; messenger RNA; genetics; human; metabolism; protein synthesis; ribosome; software; Humans; Protein Biosynthesis; Protein Isoforms; Ribosomes; RNA, Messenger; Software","Wu, W.-S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: wessonwu@mail.ncku.edu.tw

At first, the dynamic model of a three-phase IM drive is transformed into two-axe orthogonal model (i.e. d and q axes) in the synchronously rotating frame so that vector control can be applied. Then, based on the stator flux oriented scheme (i.e. zero stator flux at q-axis and constant at d-axis), the proposed MSMC causes mechanical angular speed and stator current at q-axis reach toward predefined sliding surfaces. Moreover, stator flux and current at d-axis are respectively indirect and direct controlled such that tracking errors approach toward designed sliding surfaces. The closed-loop stability of the proposed MSMC is proved to possess uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) performance by Lyapunov stability criteria. Furthermore, the simulation results reveal that the proposed MSMC strategy has a high level of robustness despite addition of an external load and random uncertainties on system parameters. In the meantime, the simulations for comparing the baseline controller (i.e. conventional PI control) are also conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed control scheme. ?

Although many approaches on visual servoing have been proposed, surprisingly, only a few of them have taken into account system dynamics in the control design of a visual servoing system. In addition, the depth information of feature points is essential in the image-based visual servoing architecture. As a result, to cope with the aforementioned problems, this article proposes a Kalman filter-based depth and velocity estimator and a modified image-based dynamic visual servoing architecture that takes into consideration the system dynamics in its control design. In particular, the Kalman filter is exploited to deal with the problems caused by vision latency and image noise so as to facilitate the estimation of the joint velocity of the robot using image information only. Moreover, in the modified image-based dynamic visual servoing architecture, the computed torque control scheme is used to compensate for system dynamics and the Kalman filter is used to provide accurate depth information of the feature points. Results of visual servoing experiments conducted on a two-degree of freedom planar robot verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ?

The radio-frequency sputtering technique was adopted for the subsequent depositions of the transparent ITO and BaTiO3 layers, while a proton-exchange method was utilized to fabricate the bus waveguides immersed in LiNbO3. The ReRAM-based microdisk resonator thus designed and fabricated has the novel functionality of memory and optical spectral filtering combined dually. As the ReRAM microdisk resonator is electronically switched between the two different memory states, or the high-resistance state (HRS) and low-resistance state (LRS), the output spectral observed at both the through and drop ports are noticeably shifted with one another before and after subjecting the ReRAM to a required forming process. Specifically, the spectral shift associated with the LRS state of ReRAM between the through and drop port terminal was approximately 0.4 nm, while roughly 0.6 nm was measured with the HRS state of ReRAM between the same two terminals. The resultant light wave filtering allows the spectrum of the interest to be selectively tuned as the ReRAM device dimensions are varied. Utilizing the different thin-film materials for ReRAM fabrication may also prove beneficial for spectral tuning. In light of different spectral shifts observed, the particular memory state of ReRAM could uniquely be interrogated by an optical means.

Therefore, this study mainly analyzes and summarizes the electrical response of the device to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation; the main emphases will be placed on the rotational direction of the hysteresis window and the width of the hysteresis window when components of different dimensions are compared with one another. To administer the comparisons impartially, the pertinent surface-to-volume ratios of these nanowire transistors are used as the gauging parameters. As the device measurements would demonstrate, Hysteresis rotating in a clockwise direction is attributed to the oxide layer defects, while the counterclockwise direction is induced by the ferroelectric effect. Needless to say, the quality of the device itself is still contingent upon the gate oxide robustness and the quality of its adjacent interfaces.

The frequency synthesizer generates sinusoidal voltage signals to a sample under test (SUT), and the resulting current signal from the SUT is sensed and sent to the ADIC for postprocessing. In fact, this sensed signal is proportional to the SUT admittance, rather than to its impedance. Hence, the proposed ADIC has two functions: taking the reciprocal of the sensed signal to make it proportional to impedance and converting it into a digital signal.

In this paper, we demonstrate the surface passivation effects in AlGaN/AlN/GaN-based MOS-HEMTs using ultraviolet-ozone (UV/O3) plasma treatment prior to SiO2-gate dielectric deposition. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to verify the improved passivation of the GaN surface.

However, the demand is usually unmet due to the imbalance of profit. In this paper, we propose a multi-criteria route recommendation framework that considers real-time spatial-temporal predictions and traffic network information, aiming to optimize a taxi driver’s profit when the driver has an advance reservation. Our framework consists of four components. First, we build a grid-based road network graph for modeling traffic network information during the search routes process. Next, we conduct two prediction modules that adopt advanced deep learning techniques to guide a proper search direction in the final planning stage. One module, taxi demand prediction, is used to estimate the pick-up probabilities of passengers in the city. Another one is destination prediction, which can predict the distribution of drop-off probabilities and capture the flow of potential passengers. Finally, we propose our J* (J-star) algorithm, which jointly considers pick-up probabilities, drop-off distribution, road network, distance, and time factors based on the attentive heuristic function. Compared with existing route planning methods, the experimental results on a real-world dataset (NYC taxi datasets) have shown our proposed approach is more effective and robust. Moreover, our designed search scheme in J* can decrease the computing time and make the search process more efficient.

Platooning vehicles with cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) mode can potentially result in a small distance between vehicles with assured string stability. This CACC-based platoon control can be realized by vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) or vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication between vehicles. In this regard, the distributed control framework is widely used. It claims robustness to communication uncertainties since each vehicle has its controller. With the rapid research on V2X, the centralized framework is another option for the platooning vehicle control framework. This paper investigates and analyzes the centralized and distributed control framework under platoon uncertainty. In most of the papers, the platoon uncertainty is considered as road slope and vehicle dynamics model. In this paper, the platoon uncertainty refers to the platoon types, namely homogeneous and heterogeneous platoon. The analytical platoon stability is studied for both frameworks under different platoon types. It gives the minimum time gap boundary to guarantee string stability for both frameworks. The numerical string stability is performed by the simulation to verify the analytical. The simulation is done using the integrated PreScan and Matlab/Simulink. Then, the robustness of both frameworks is evaluated under latency and packet loss.

Since the proposed circuit uses the PWM method, the mini-LED can be operated at the best luminance-efficacy point, minimizing the power consumption of the circuit. The electrical characteristic of fabricated LTPS TFTs are measured to establish a simulation model to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed circuit. Simulation results demonstrate that the relative mini-LED current error rates are below 9% when the VTH varies &#x00B1; 0.3 V and VSS rises by 1 V. With respect to precise control of the gray level, the time shifts of current pulses are within 11.48 us over the whole grayscale. The improvement in the power consumption of the proposed circuit is more than 21% than that of a circuit that is driven by pulse amplitude modulation.

This work develops a novel cognitive assessment interactive embedded system, which consists of a micro-controller unit (MCU), organic light-emitting diode (OLED) modules and a client identification circuit. The reliability of the proposed system is demonstrated in visuospatial memory tests. With its combination of OLED modules and pressable components, the elderly can use the system to perform testing under a flashing light source sequence with tactile feedback. To identify the various pattern arrangements in the Corsi block tapping task (CBTT), the client identification circuit in the proposed system is implemented to compute the number of OLED lighting devices on each column of the wooden base. The data that are collected from each subject will be transferred to cloud servers through a smart phone APP via wireless networks to eliminate recording errors by the experimenter. The functionality of the spatial working memory is verified in experiments that involve the proposed OLED, a computerized version of the CBTT, and 24 participants.

Taiwanese government launched a free oral cancer screening program. The aim of this study was to analyze the malignant transformation rate of OPMDs. This study was based on national-wide oral screening databases. 3,362,232 people were enrolled. Patients clinically diagnosed with leukoplakia, erythroplakia, oral submucosal fibrosis (OSF), oral verrucous hyperplasia (OVH), and oral lichen planus (OLP), from 2010 to 2013, were identified. We followed up OPMD patients in cancer registry databases to analyze the malignant transformation rate. The malignant transformation rates from the highest to the lowest were: OVH > OSF > erythroplakia > OLP > leukoplakia. The malignant transformation rate was 24.55, 12.76, 9.75, 4.23, and 0.60 per 1000 person-years in the OVH, OSF, erythroplakia, leukoplakia, and comparison cohort. The hazard ratio was 8.19 times higher in the OPMD group compared with comparison cohort group, after age and habit adjustment. Female patients with OPMDs had a high risk of malignant transformation. Nationwide screening is very important for early diagnosis. OVH had the highest malignant transformation possibility. Female OPMD patients are a rare but have a relatively high malignant transformation rate.

These effects are mainly related to the intensity, duration, frequency, and pattern of the ELF-EMF. Our intent was to characterize the effect of specific pulsed electromagnetic fields on the in vitro proliferation of MCF-7 adenocarcinoma and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines and one non-cancerous M10 breast epithelial cell line. The following four important parameters of ELF-EMF were examined: frequencies (7.83?±?0.3, 23.49?±?0.3, and 39.15?±?0.3?Hz), flux density (0.5 and 1 mT), exposure duration (12, 24, and 48?h), and the exposure methodology (continuous exposure versus switching exposure). The viability of MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to the optimized ELF-EMF pattern (7.83?±?0.3?Hz, 1 mT, and 6?h switching exposure) was 40.1%. By contrast, the optimized ELF-EMF parameters that were most cytotoxic to breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells were not damaging to normal M10 cells. In vitro studies also showed that exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells to the optimized ELF-EMF pattern promoted Ca2+ influx and resulted in apoptosis. These data confirm that exposure to this specific ELF-EMF pattern can influence cellular processes and inhibit cancer cell growth.

The main idea is to restrict the numbers of allowable contentions to the low-energy devices (LEDs) by using the proposed make-or-break (MOB) backoff scheme such that the unnecessary energy consumption can be reduced. And, consequently, the high-energy devices (HEDs) can have higher probability to attain time slots for data transmissions. However, the restriction mechanism may detain the data forwarding process. To solve this dilemma, the adaptive frame structure is developed to compensate the loss of throughput. The analytical as well as simulation results demonstrate that with a huge amount of machine type devices (MTDs), the proposed scheme can outperform the conventional counterpart in the aspects of the head-of-line delay, energy efficiency and accommodation of the MTDs. ? 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.",Collision avoidance; Energy efficiency; Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications; Media access control (mac) protocol,Automation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Medium access control; Adaptive frame; Backoff; Collision problem; Data-forwarding; Energy devices; Head of lines; Hybrid MAC protocols; Time slots; Machine-to-machine communication,"Chang, W.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: wenson@ee.ncku.edu.tw",English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101276908

In this paper, we aim to deploy a scalable and self-organized UAV-assisted device-to-device (D2D) communication network using a minimum number of UAV-BSs (UBSs) under some link quality constraints. Specifically, a sequential UBS deploying algorithm is designed to guarantee the signal quality for the links between the UBSs and ground terminals, and those between UBSs and central controller.

In particular, for tension control, by taking into account the effect of friction and the dynamic moment of inertia, this paper proposes a modified sensorless tension estimation approach. Finally, a roll-to-roll system is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. ? 2020 The Chinese Institute of Engineers.",disturbance compensator; Roll-to-roll manufacturing process; sensorless tension estimation; tension control,Friction; Speed control; Speed regulators; Transmissions; Disturbance compensation; Disturbance compensator; External disturbances; Positioning accuracy; Roll to roll manufacturing; Roll-to-roll systems; Tension estimation; Transmission speed; Substrates,"Cheng, M.-Y.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: mycheng@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098573240

As the molded-type coil is developed toward miniaturization, the granules consisting of magnetic powder and organic binder cannot uniformly fill the small space in the coil center column during molding. This leads to a porous microstructure or cracks. In this study, magnetic alloy powder coils were prepared using a screen-printing process using high-solid-content magnetic pastes. The magnetic powder was surface-modified with titanate coupling agent to improve the magnetic powder and epoxy resin compatibility, thereby improving magnetic powder mixing with epoxy resin and reducing the high solid content magnetic paste viscosity. The experimental results showed that the relative density and magnetic properties (such initial permeability, core loss, and coercivity) can be significantly enhanced using titanate coupling agent surface modification. ? 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,Coupling agents; Epoxy resins; Iron alloys; Magnetic materials; Magnetic properties; Screen printing; High solid content; Initial permeability; Iron-based alloy; Porous microstructure; Relative density; Screen-printing process; Surface-modified; Titanate coupling agents; Magnetism,"Hsiang, H.-I.; Department of Resources Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: hsingi@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098528574

However, because of the influence of the working environment, aging, and other factors, the resonant frequency of the primary varies. Moreover, the reflected equivalent impedance of the secondary coil may affect the design of a resonant tank with a constant switching frequency. In this brief, a multilevel inverter (MLI) without the resonant circuit tuning is proposed for the CPT system. The proposed inverter can produce a high-frequency ac voltage with an approximated sinusoidal envelope for the primary coil. According to the equation developed for the inverter, low-order harmonics can be eliminated by selecting an appropriate input voltage ratio and switching angles for the switches. Furthermore, the cancelation of multiple harmonics can be achieved by designing multilevel circuits. The advantages of the proposed MLI include the reduction in low-order harmonics, low voltage stress, and high reliability. Hardware experimental results were obtained for a CPT system prototype to verify the performance of the proposed MLI. ? 2004-2012 IEEE.",Contactless power transfer system; harmonic elimination; multilevel inverter; wireless power transfer,Energy transfer; Harmonic analysis; Inductive power transmission; Natural frequencies; Resonant circuits; Switching frequency; Constant switching frequency; Contactless power transfer systems; Contactless power transfers (CPT); Equivalent impedance; Low order harmonics; Multi Level Inverter (MLI); Voltage source inverter; Working environment; Electric inverters,"Lo, K.-Y.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: kylo@mail.ee.nkust.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098259931

Taiwanese was commonly used language in Taiwan before, but now it is facing the dilemma of declining. Therefore, maintaining traditional culture in the ever-changing trend is a major issue. In this study, we developed the Taiwanese speech recognition system which the Kaldi Toolkit was used to implement. The Taiwanese corpus was collected by Taiwan Taiwanese National Reading Competition and Classmate Recording, and about 11 hours of audio files were collected in total. Because the training data is a small dataset, two data augmentation methods are used to increase the training data, so that the acoustic model can be more robust and more effective training. One method is speed perturbation, which speeds up the original data by 1.1 times and slows it down by 0.9 times. Another method is to use multi-condition training data to simulate the reverberation of the original speech and add background noise. The background noise includes music, speech, and noise. The acoustic model is trained for different hybrid deep neural network architectures which can use the advantages of each neural network by hybrid different neural networks, such as CNN-LSTM-TDNN. In the experimental results, the CER in the domain of language modeling reaches 3.95%, and the CER of the online decoding test is 3.06%. Compared with other research on Taiwanese speech recognition of similar dataset size, the recognition results are better than other studies. ? 2020 IEEE.",Data Augmentation; Deep Neural Network Acoustic Model; Speech Recognition; Taiwanese,Acoustic noise; Citrus fruits; Deep neural networks; Long short-term memory; Modeling languages; Network architecture; Perturbation techniques; Reverberation; Speech; Acoustic model; Background noise; Changing trends; Data augmentation; Language model; Multi-condition trainings; Speech recognition systems; Traditional cultures; Speech recognition,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112417742

If there is a mistake in the process of packaging medicines, it may cause great harm to patients. This research is aimed at the development of automatic drug image verification functions. Our system is composed of two stages. The first stage is arbitrary axis-aligned object detector, which is mainly based on deep residual network and feature pyramid network(FPN). The detector predicts the rotation bounding boxes for drugs by multi-scale feature maps generated by FPN. Then, the rotation bounding boxes are axially aligned, and the drug image is cropped according to axis-aligned bounding box. The second stage is feature matcher, which is based on feature embedding network. The embedding feature extracted by feature embedding network is combined with the geometric feature obtained by arbitrary axis-aligned object detector to determine whether the drug in image is belonging to expected category that user specify. Our system can detect multiscale rotating drugs and can identify drugs at any position, angle, and placement surface. And due to the addition of geometric features, it can effectively identify drugs with similar appearance but different sizes. Finally, according to the experimental results, a high accuracy rate of 0.047% FAR can be obtained. ? 2020 IEEE.",Deep Residual Network; Drug Detection; Feature Pyramid Network; Image Feature Embedded Network; Medication Safety,Citrus fruits; Embeddings; Object detection; Axis-aligned bounding boxes; Drug recognition; Feature embedding; Geometric feature; Image verification; Medication safety; Multi-scale features; Object detectors; Feature extraction,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112415537

The enrolled participants included patients with DM. Fresh urine hs-TnI levels were measured. Medical records of enrolled patients were used to determine the number of incident CV events prospectively for 3 months. The study cohort comprised 378 participants. We observed significantly higher levels of urine hs-TnI in those with than without subsequent incident CV events. The multivariate logistic regression analysis using different models consistently showed that urine hs-TnI > 4.10 pg/mL was an independent factor predictive of incident CV events. The ROC-AUC analysis revealed that the optimal cutoff value for urine hs-TnI for predicting incident CV events was 1.55 pg/mL and the area was 0.611 (p = 0.027).

The use of the fast region-based convolutional neural network (Fast R-CNN)-driven model was to augment and improve the existing automated non-destructive testing (NDT) diagnosis. Within the context of X-ray screening, limited numbers and insufficient types of X-ray aeronautics engine defect data samples can, thus, pose another problem in the performance accuracy of training models tackling multiple detections. To overcome this issue, we employed a deep learning paradigm of transfer learning tackling both single and multiple detection. Overall, the achieved results obtained more than 90% accuracy based on the aeronautics engine radiographic testing inspection system net (AE-RTISNet) retrained with eight types of defect detection. Caffe structure software was used to perform network tracking detection over multiple Fast R-CNNs. We determined that the AE-RTISNet provided the best results compared with the more traditional multiple Fast R-CNN approaches, which were simple to translate to C++ code and installed in the Jetson?

While considering that CPU, display device, and WakeLocks are the main sources of power consumption that should be managed on Android platforms, this study focuses on managing the power consumption of CPU on smart glasses. The reason is that, based on the features of smart glasses, the much smaller display device and the potentially less misuse of WakeLock do not seem to be the power drains and, therefore, the supplied power is mostly consumed by CPU. The solution developed in this study is presented in the form of a user app (short for application) of power management in order not to directly modify the system internals of Android and to achieve portability. Its implementation takes advantage of the built-in power management mechanism of Android system in order to achieve its functionalities and uses the technique of dynamic messages to assist users in applying, setting up, and saving the desired power plans. The app works by extending the built-in power management functions of the host Android system and imposes no impact on the built-in power governors. For the purpose of enhancing user experience, customized power plans are built as the preset user defined power plans. The settings in these power plans are derived from measuring the real power consumption in common use cases of smart glasses.

In sprint planning, the team develops product functionality to fulfill the selected product backlog items. In order to implement the product functionality, the team plans needed activities and then decomposes the activities into tasks. When dependent tasks are assigned to different developers, there is need for coordination between developers. The needs of coordination are difficult to quantify, however, quantification of the needs of coordination is an important factor to accurately estimate team performance of a sprint. In this paper, a method is proposed to calculate distribution of task dependency among developers, and the distribution is defined as Coordination Needs. An experiment on an open source project, Spring, demonstrates that the Coordination Needs is strongly correlated with team performance. With the method, the Coordination Needs of task allocation is revealed so team performance of a sprint can be accurately estimated, and task allocation can be optimized. ? 2020 IEEE.",coordination; coordination needs; scrum; task allocation; task dependency; team performance estimation,Dependent tasks; Development teams; Open source projects; Task allocation; Task dependencies; Team performance; Human resource management,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102194066

We show here that the prion ([SWI+]) and mutant (swi1?) forms of Swi1, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, confer dramatically distinct transcriptomic profiles. In [SWI+] cells, genes encoding for 34 transcription factors (TFs) and 24 Swi1-interacting proteins can undergo transcriptional modifications. Several TFs show enhanced aggregation in [SWI+] cells. Further analyses suggest that?such alterations are key factors in specifying the transcriptomic signatures of [SWI+] cells. Interestingly, swi1? and [SWI+] impose distinct and oftentimes opposite effects on cellular functions. Translation-associated activities, in particular, are significantly reduced in swi1? cells. Although both swi1? and [SWI+] cells are similarly sensitive to thermal, osmotic and drought stresses, harmful, neutral or beneficial effects were observed for?a?panel of tested chemical stressors. Further analyses suggest that the environmental stress response (ESR) is mechanistically different between swi1? and [SWI+] cells—stress-inducible ESR (iESR) are repressed by [SWI+] but unchanged by swi1? while stress-repressible ESR (rESR) are induced by [SWI+] but repressed by swi1?. Our work thus demonstrates primarily gain-of-function outcomes through transcriptomic modifications by [SWI+] and highlights a prion-mediated regulation of transcription and phenotypes in yeast. ? 2020, The Author(s).",,"nonhistone protein; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; SWI1 protein, S cerevisiae; transcription factor; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; metabolism; osmotic pressure; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Osmotic Pressure; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Transcription Factors; Transcription, Genetic","Du, Z.; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, United States; 電子郵件: z-du@northwestern.edu

However, the combined GPS/GLONASS PPP is not always guaranteed to provide a better solution than GPS PPP alone due to data quality issues. To improve this problem, we propose a new observation model for GPS/GLONASS PPP. We adopt a between-satellite single-difference (BSSD) combination and carrier smoothing (CS) techniques for GPS and GLONASS observations. The proposed BSSD-CS is shown to be effective in the improvement of performance of GPS/GLONASS PPP. A 7-day data set from 19 IGS stations are used to assess and verify the effectiveness of the proposed PPP model in static modes. Furthermore, three different GNSS receivers are used to investigate the potential of the proposed PPP model. It is shown that the proposed GPS/GLONASS PPP model can indeed reduce the convergence time and achieve better positioning precision in comparison with traditional GPS/GLONASS PPP models. In addition, even used with a low-cost GNSS receiver, the proposed PPP can still yield decimeter-level positioning accuracy and precision within a few minutes, which is as precise as and as fast as using a high-end GNSS receiver. ? 2020, The Aeronautical and Astronautical Society of the Republic of China.

The major challenge of stereo matching is to suppress inevitable errors occurring in smooth, occluded, and discontinuous regions. In this paper, the proposed stereo matching system uses segment-based superpixels and matching cost. After determination of edge and smooth regions and selection of matching cost, we suggest the segment-based adaptive support weights in cost aggregation instead of color similarity and spatial proximity only. The proposed dual-path depth refinements use the cross-based support region by referring texture features to correct the inaccurate disparities with iterative procedures to improve the depth maps for shape reserving. Specially for leftmost and rightmost regions, the segment-based refinement can greatly improve the mismatched disparity holes. The experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve?higher accurate depth maps than?the conventional methods. ? 2020, The Author(s).",,Iterative methods; Stereo image processing; Stereo vision; Textures; Adaptive support weights; Color similarity; Conventional methods; Cost aggregations; Spatial proximity; Stereo matching; Support regions; Texture features; Color matching,"Yang, J.-F.; Department of Electrical Engineering, 1, University Rd, Taiwan; 電子郵件: jefyang@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090286668

Their unique reproductive characteristics of orchid are attracted by scientist for centuries. One of the synapomorphies of orchid plants is that their seeds do not contain endosperm. Lipids are used as major energy storage in orchid seeds. However, regulation and mobilization of lipid usage during early seedling (protocorm) stage of orchid is not understood. In this study, we compared transcriptomes from developing Phalaenopsis aphrodite protocorms grown on 1/2-strength MS medium with sucrose. The expression of P. aphrodite MALATE SYNTHASE (PaMLS), involved in the glyoxylate cycle, was significantly decreased from 4 days after incubation (DAI) to 7 DAI. On real-time RT-PCR, both P. aphrodite ISOCITRATE LYASE (PaICL) and PaMLS were down-regulated during protocorm development and suppressed by sucrose treatment. In addition, several genes encoding transcription factors regulating PaMLS expression were identified. A gene encoding homeobox transcription factor (named PaHB5) was involved in positive regulation of PaMLS. This study showed that sucrose regulates the glyoxylate cycle during orchid protocorm development in asymbiotic germination and provides new insights into the transcription factors involved in the regulation of malate synthase expression. ? 2020, The Author(s).",,"glyoxylic acid; glyoxylic acid derivative; malate synthase; transcription factor; transcriptome; carbohydrate metabolism; gene expression; gene expression regulation; genetics; germination; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Orchidaceae; physiology; plant seed; seedling; symbiosis; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Germination; Glyoxylates; Malate Synthase; Orchidaceae; Seedlings; Seeds; Symbiosis; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome","Tsai, W.-C.; Institute of Tropical Plant Sciences and Microbiology, Taiwan; 電子郵件: tsaiwc@mail.ncku.edu.tw

These components are commonly fabricated on rigid substrates. However, the same synthesis method cannot be used to fabricate these components on flexible substrates. In this work, we present a method to fabricate metal?semiconductor?metal ultraviolet photodetectors with ZnO nanorods on flexible substrates. It is observed that the overall characteristics of the fabricated ZnO nanorod photodetector are greatly enhanced by doping with gallium (Ga). The nanorods are grown on a flexible substrate (poly(ethylene 2,6-naphthalate)) at a low temperature of 80 °C. The performance of Ga-doped ZnO nanorods (GZO) shows a significant improvement in electrical measurements compared to pure ZnO nanorods. The photocurrent-to-dark current ratios of both ZnO and GZO nanorod-based photodetectors are approximately 8.5 and 570.2 under a 1 V bias, respectively. The dark current and photocurrent are substantially improved by the addition of the Ga dopant. Transient response measurements indicated that the GZO nanorod photodetectors are stable and reproducible, and no change in the current?voltage characteristics is noted after multiple bending cycles. These results indicate that Ga-doping can improve the ZnO nanorod optical and electric characteristics; this proposed method is useful for device fabrication on low-melting-point substrates to produce flexible cost-effective devices. ? 2020 American Chemical Society",Flexible; Gallium-doped zinc oxide; Hydrothermal; Metal?semiconductor?metal; Nanostructures; Photodetector; Poly(ethylene naphathalate) (PEN),Cost effectiveness; Dark currents; Energy gap; Ethylene; Fabrication; II-VI semiconductors; Magnetic semiconductors; Nanorods; Oxide minerals; Oxide semiconductors; Photocurrents; Photodetectors; Photons; Semiconducting zinc compounds; Semiconductor doping; Substrates; Temperature; Transient analysis; Wide band gap semiconductors; Zinc oxide; Electric characteristics; Electrical measurement; Gallium doped zinc oxides; Optoelectronic properties; Overall characteristics; Response measurement; Ultra-violet photodetectors; Voltage characteristics; Gallium compounds,"Young, S.-J.; Department of Electronic Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: shengjoueyoung@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096826723

One such human-robot cooperation application is to teach a robot to execute a certain task by simply using the operator's hand to drag the end-effector of the robot to move along a desired path or move to a desired goal position. It is a more intuitive and convenient solution compared with traditional teach pendant. To make the robot compliant to the applied force of the human operator, compliance control schemes such as impedance control and admittance control are often used. The external force information is essential when implementing compliance control. In this paper, both force sensors and observer-based approaches such as the generalized momentum method are used to estimate external torque/force. Finally, the compliance control-based teach pendant developed in this paper is applied to a 6-axis industrial robot. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach exhibits satisfactory performance. ? 2020 IEEE.",compliance control; disturbance observer; external force estimation; human-robot interaction,Automation; End effectors; Industrial robots; Process control; Social robots; Admittance control; Applied forces; External force estimation; External torque; Generalized momentum method; Human operator; Human-robot cooperation; Impedance control; Compliance control,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099767383

The stability issue, however, must address the heterogeneity in the highway. The heterogeneity may compromise platooning vehicles' potentials such as traffic efficiency, safety, smoothness, and fuel efficiency. For instance, the existence of human driving vehicles on the highway enables mixed platoon vehicles to occur. Nevertheless, the strict string stability is the most used to judge the platooning vehicles' stability, can be only used when the platoon consists of all connected autonomous vehicles. After that, several criteria come up to solve mixed platoons such as head-to-tail string stability. However, head-to-tail string stability allows the middle platoon's oscillation to compromise platooning vehicles' potential. This paper proposed a new string stability criterion to deal with mixed traffic without compromising the platooning vehicles' potentials. It transforms the platoon into the sub-platoon based on human driving vehicles' position. The mixed platoon stability is checked based on each sub-platoon interconnection, where the following sub-platoon does not magnify the magnitude of the perturbation. Therefore, it is called sub-platoon strict string stability. The effectiveness of sub-platoon strict string stability is shown through the analysis and numerical example. ? 2020 IEEE.",Connected autonomous vehicles; cooperative adaptive cruise control; head-to-tail string stability; human driving vehicles; mixed platoon; sub-platoon strict string stability,Adaptive cruise control; Automation; Efficiency; Numerical methods; Process control; Speed control; Vehicles; Cooperative adaptive cruise control; Fuel efficiency; Mixed traffic; Platoon stabilities; Stability issues; String stability; Traffic efficiency; Vehicular platoons; Stability criteria,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099749815

Various features in the prediction model are considered: some of them (e.g., hourly weather, traffic volumes) are dynamic every hour, while others (e.g., road network, point-of-interests) are static. To boost the effectiveness of static features, we propose a dynamic training process to transform the static features into dynamics. After that, all features can vary with time so that they are capable of handling a real-time prediction scenario. Moreover, we propose an attention mechanism for enhancing our bi-directional ConvLSTM model.

One of the ACES services is the platooning vehicle, where a group of vehicles moves together with the cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) and other safety features. Sensors and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication are a crucial part of succeeding in the implementation of platooning vehicles. In this work, we consider radar and camera sensors as the primary concern. Those sensors provide relative distance and velocity between vehicles where is the key to maintain a safe distance between vehicles during platooning. In practice, both sensors are subject to several critical issues, such as faults, malfunction, and sensor degradation. Besides, in the transmission and processing of sensor data, errors may occur due to delay, noise, and cyber-attacks. These issues may affect the safety and stability of an ACES system For a platoon operating under CACC, the string stability may be addressed. Therefore, this paper aims to solve sensor fault issues with the proposed strategy for fault detection and estimation in the presence of noise uncertainty, and perturbation. The proposed strategy integrates parameter estimation and the state estimation approach. The modified, extended recursive least square (MERLS) with exponential forgetting factor and Kalman filter is considered to deal with the system have noise. The model is obtained by MERLS and used by the Kalman filter to detects the sensor's fault based on the residual. When the sensor fault detected, a robust estimation from the Kalman filter is employed as fault-tolerant control that guarantees impressive performance after sensor fault occurs, subject to safety and string stability. ? 2020 IEEE",Autonomous connected electric shared vehicles; Cooperative adaptive cruise control; Fault detection and estimation; Parameter and state estimation; Platooning vehicle; Sensor fault,Adaptive cruise control; Kalman filters; Network security; Speed control; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicles; Cooperative adaptive cruise control; Detection and estimation; Estimation approaches; Exponential forgetting; Extended recursive least squares; Fault tolerant control; Noise uncertainties; Safety and stabilities; Fault detection,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104865766

In this paper, two approaches to predict the test pattern counts and test data volumes with different input channel counts are presented, one with the compression tool able to generate channel-scaling patterns and the other without this capability. The results can be used to determine the scan test configuration that results in the smallest or near smallest test data volume.

Generally, the main idea of these works is to avoid unnecessary collisions during the discovery period. However, owing to the limited resources for D2D discovery, the effectiveness of the collision avoidance based schemes is always restricted. Instead, we aim to make the discovery beacon robust against collisions. To achieve this, the cyclic block spreading (CBS) scheme is proposed to spreading the beacon over multiple subframes without widening the bandwidth and the need of redesigning the beacon.

To this end, we develop the multi-cell cooperative scheduling (MCCS) algorithm together with the cooperative scheduling indexes (COSIs) for maximizing the data rate, maximizing the Jain's fairness index and reaching a better tradeoff in-between. For convenience, they are denoted by the COSIs for the CMDR, CMMF and CPF schedulers, respectively. However, its high computational complexity may somehow resists its from practical applications. Thus, a low-complexity cooperative proportional fairness (LC-CPF) algorithm is designed to well approach the MCCS algorithm using the CPF COSI; and at the meantime, the order of computational complexity can be significantly reduced. Moreover, its ability to reach a better tradeoff can still be maintained under the impact of high spectrum-sharing interference. In addition, it is interesting to find that using the proposed cooperative scheduling methods, the open-loop power control mechanism is no longer required for compensating the differences of received signal quality between users. ? 1967-2012 IEEE.",Cooperative scheduling; massive mimo; pilot contamination; proportional fair,Computational complexity; MIMO systems; Power control; Cooperative scheduling; Data rates; Fairness index; Open-loop; Pilot contaminations; Proportional fairness; Received signals; Spectrum sharing; Scheduling,"Hua, Y.-K.; Department of Artificial Intelligence, Taiwan; 電子郵件: g901305@hotmail.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096330558

With these treatments, the surface roughness of the organic deposited on CuSCN was reduced from 4.25 to 1.28 nm. The optical transmittance was also enhanced. Additionally, the CuSCN surface energy and polarity were considerably increased and the hole-injection barrier was decreased from 0.70 to 0.47 eV.

Most previous work has focused on unsigned networks, which means the existence of polarity relationships has largely been disregarded. In this work, we define a Sign-aware Influence Maximization (SIM) problem, which involves identification of the seed set that would simultaneously maximize positive influence and minimize negative influence. We begin by considered competitive influence under various dominance mechanisms on SCIC model, which extends the classic Independent Cascade (IC) model by incorporating binary opinions and signed relationships. We then proved that the influence of SIM under the SCIC model is non-monotonic and non-submodular, which implies that simple greedy hill-climbing would be unable to achieve an approximation ratio of 1-1/e in seeking to resolve the SIM problem. We then developed a simulation-based algorithm called Sign-aware Competitive Maximum Influence Arborescence (S-CMIA) to simulate the propagation of influence within a local region. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over existing methods in resolving the SIM problem in terms of reward. ? 2020 IEEE.",Competitive Independent Cascade Model; Influence Maximization; Signed Social Networks,Approximation ratios; CASCADE model; Hill climbing; Influence maximizations; Local region; Signed networks; Simulation-based algorithms; Submodular; Advanced Analytics,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097980038

This system includes a prototype detection module and a display interface, and it is implemented as a wearable device. The prototype detection module consists of a low dropout regulator (commercial IC) utilized to regulate a stable DC voltage with 3.7 V Li-ion battery for a whole wearable device and a customized capacitance-to-digital converter (CDC) chip is employed to convert capacitances into the digital data. The CDC includes a capacitance-to-voltage converter (CVC) and 10-bit successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter are fabricated via the TSMC 0.18 μ m 1P6M 3.3 V process. CVC is characterized by its selectability of detection points from 1 to 64 (8×8 cross-type capacitive array). This type of converter is controlled by digital codes of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and has embedded functions of a self-separated input signal, which is applied to scan each detection point of the cross-type capacitive sensors, and a crosstalk attenuation (CA) is used to reduce parasitic capacitances and the effects of relative humidity and temperature of the environment for cross-type capacitive sensors. To demonstrate improvements of the CA, a multi-physics simulation software, COMSOL Multiphysics, was utilized to verify the performance of the CA. The handmade 4 ×4 CCPP sensor is modeled in COMSOL Multiphysics and simulated with/without CA. Finally, the simulated results reveal that the function of CA can reduce parasitic capacitances and the effects of the relative humidity and temperature caused by the environment effectively at the femtofarad level. The cross-type structure of a capacitive array has an advantage due to an Mtimes; N array, which only requires M + N tracks of input/output (I/O) ports to reduce the complexity of I/O connections. The measured results of the prototype detection module shown on the display interfaces reveal the positions and strengths of the corresponding capacitances of the CCPP sensor.

Serum N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is widely used to assist diagnosis and predict clinical outcomes in HF patients. Few studies have investigated the use of urine NT-proBNP as an HF biomarker. This study aims to assess the value of urine NT-proBNP for predicting ED visits for decompensated HF as compared with that of serum NT-proBNP. Methods and results: This study included 122 HF patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (<50%). Serum and urine NT-proBNP levels were measured. Baseline data included demographics, comorbidities, and co-medications. Medical records were used to determine the incidence of visits to the ED for decompensated HF during the 3?months following the last visit. We observed significantly higher levels of both serum and urine NT-proBNP in patients with subsequent ED visits than in those without. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that urine NT-proBNP/creatinine ratio (OR, 1.031; 95% CI, 1.001–1.061; P?=?0.046) but not serum NT-proBNP was an independent factor associated with subsequent ED visits. According to receiver-operating characteristic?area under the curve analysis, the optimal cut-off value of urine NT-proBNP/creatinine ratio for predicting subsequent heart-failure related ED visits was 0.272?pg/μg Cr (area under the curve, 0.675; P?=?0.011). Conclusions: For HF patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, a single measurement of urinary NT-proBNP/creatinine ratio is predictive of subsequent ED visits for decompensated HF. This non-invasive and easy measurement may be a clinically useful tool for monitoring clinical outcomes and identifying a subset of patients at higher risk of ED visits within a short time. ? 2020 The Authors.

A pencil lead with 0.3mm in diameter was used to evaluate the lateral resolution (400um). A 3D alphabet phantom made by a 3D printer were successfully imaged by self-designed PAI system. In Summary, the potential of using this acoustic sensor as a PA imager of wearable body sensor network applications was positive based on the results. ? 2020 IEEE.",PAI; PVDF; Transducer; Wearable sensor,3D printers; Bandwidth; Body sensor networks; Fluorine compounds; Neodymium lasers; Tin oxides; Transducers; Ultrasonic transducers; Yttrium aluminum garnet; Acoustic Sensors; Fractional bandwidths; Imaging performance; Indium tin oxide; Lateral resolution; Photoacoustic signals; Polyvinylidene fluorides; Volumetric Imaging; Wearable sensors,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097910538

Multidimensional and comprehensive information about temperature distribution can be used to optimize the performance of industrial processes. AT is a promising method for visualizing the 2D temperature field. The key challenge is to improve the accuracy of the relative spatial distribution and the absolute temperature value. Thus, this paper presents an alternative way to improve the reconstruction of the temperature field distribution by analyzing the effect of the grid structure and acoustic paths. In order to achieve this spatial moving average technique (MAT) have been studied and implemented across different grid structures (hexagon, square, and polar). Several numerical simulations were conducted to analyze the accuracy of the reconstructed temperature field using these three grid shapes. The effect of grid size was also analyzed. It was found that the hexagonal grid is more sensitive to the shift of hot spots and more accurate in the peak temperature. A hexagonal grid whose radius of the circumscribed circle is equal to 7 % of the sample diameter could efficiently detect a 3 % shift of the hotspot with less than 5 % error in the peak temperature. This simulation result was supported experimentally by 12 ultrasonic transceivers arranged in a circular pattern with 1 m in diameter. ? 2020 IEEE.",Acoustic Tomography; Grid Shape; Hot-spot Shift; Moving Average; Temperature Distribution Field Reconstruction,Geometry; Temperature distribution; 2D temperature fields; Comprehensive information; Industrial processs; Moving average technique; Non-invasive way; Peak temperatures; Reconstruction algorithms; Temperature field distribution; Ultrasonic applications,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097878465

The channel thickness is controlled by dry etching, and the channel width was shrunk down by wet etching.

The statistics also reveals that the interference incurred by a well-designed resource-sharing scheme concentrates at a certain level. This observation hints us that as the non-uniform quantization scheme is used, solely fewer quantization bits are required to capture the main characteristic of the resource-sharing interference. Thus, in this paper, we aim to reduce the overheads for reporting the channel state information (CSI) to avoid any intolerable amount of interference caused by improperly resource sharing between V2I and V2V connections. To achieve this, the non-uniform quantization method is developed to construct the channel-quality indicator (CQI) for capturing the most informative CSI using fewer bits. Taking the conventional interference-aware graph resource-sharing scheme with perfect CSI as the baseline, we find that with regular traffic density, one-bit CQI can achieve equivalent performance. That remarkably saves 95.5% of CSI overheads without sacrificing the sum rate. ? 2000-2011 IEEE.",CQI; resource sharing; V2V; V2X; vehicular networks,Vehicle to infrastructure; Vehicles; Channel quality indicators; Interference-aware; Non-uniform quantization; Resource sharing schemes; Traffic densities; Vehicle to infrastructure (V2I); Vehicle to vehicle network (V2V); Vehicular networks; Channel state information,"Chang, W.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: wenson@ee.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090414820

In the past decade, the use of reflected GNSS signals for sensing the Earth, also known as GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R), has grown rapidly. On the other hand, with the continuous development of GNSS, multi-frequency multi-modulation signals have been used to enhance not only positioning performance, but also remote sensing applications. It is known that for some constellations, navigation satellites broadcast signals employing BPSK (binary phase-shift keying) modulation and BOC (binary offset carrier) modulation at the same frequency band. This paper proposes a new GNSS-R measurement, called a composite delay-Doppler map (cDDM), by utilizing the received reflected GNSS signals with different modulation techniques for the purpose of retrieving wind speed. The GNSS-R receiver can receive BPSK and BOC signals simultaneously at the same frequency band (e.g., GPS III L1 C/A and L1C or QZSS L1 C/A and L1C) and process the signals to generate GNSS-R measurements.

To address the above problem, this study used sensors to improve two sets of windings, whereby the forward winding and backward winding were connected in series in the coil position. As the low frequency signal neutralized the increase of induced potential through the backward winding loop path, the low frequency response hazard generated was reduced by a low frequency signal.

Life cycle and safety of the Li-ion battery strings are crucial aspects. A battery management system (BMS) is required for monitoring the status of each cell and balancing their state of charge (SoC). However, most conventional cell equalizers provide only cell monitoring and equalization functions. In this article, a parallel architecture is presented that not only achieves battery cell equalization but also is capable of providing voltage regulation for point-of-loads (POLs). In the proposed equalizer, several isolated dc-dc converters are constructed. The input terminal of each converter is connected to a battery cell, and the output terminals are connected to one point for the poststage POLs. A battery voltage acquirement system is built for SoC estimation. A central BMS controller is realized using a field-programmable gate array to receive sensed signals and control all the functions.

The influences of Ar/O2 ratio, film thickness, postannealing condition, and electrode on the RS properties were also studied. The conductive filaments are mostly related to the numbers of oxygen vacancies that can be controlled through a different deposition atmosphere Ar/O2 ratio and film thickness. In addition, the RS characteristics and operating voltage can be improved by postannealing treatment. It is suggested that the In ions diffused from ITO participated in the formation of the filaments of the RRAM.

To identify each converter's advantageous applications, the efficiencies of the 1P3S, reconfigured 2P3S, and combined 2P6S converters were analyzed under dynamic PV and load powers. The chip is fabricated in the 0.5- μm CMOS process with a 1.24-mm2 chip area. The measured peak efficiencies for the 1P3S, 2P3S, and 2P6S converters are 95.0%, 95.2%, and 90.0%, respectively, while the measured quiescent currents are 210, 130, and 140 nA, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art 2P3S and 2P6S converters, the reconfigured 2P3S and combined 2P6S converters with the proposed IC, respectively, achieve higher efficiency through appropriate switch sizes and ON-time optimizations. ? 1966-2012 IEEE.",Dual-path six-switch (2P6S); dual-path three-switch (2P3S); energy efficiency; maximum power point tracking (MPPT); photovoltaic (PV) energy harvesting; reconfigurable controller; single-path three-switch (1P3S),Electric batteries; Electric inductors; Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; High energy efficiency; Higher efficiency; Photovoltaic energy harvesting; Photovoltaic modules; Quiescent currents; Reconfigurability; Reconfigurable controllers; Time optimization; Solar power generation,"Kuo, T.-H.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: thkuo@ee.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088692249

Technology, particularly the use of mobile sensors and digital game-based learning, has the potential to enhance students' sleep hygiene, reducing insomnia and daytime sleepiness and improving students’ academic performance. Therefore, this study implemented and evaluated a sleep hygiene instruction intervention in terms of three elements: a) mobile sleep sensor data feedback for sleep self-evaluation; b) a collaborative-competitive mobile community game (MCG) for sleep promotion based on social-interdependence; and c) an instructional intervention adopting a social cognitive approach. To validate the efficacy of the instructional design, a pretest-posttest quasi-experiment was conducted with 114 10th grade students from three classes of an urban vocational high school in Taiwan. The three intact classes were randomly assigned to one of three sleep hygiene courses: a comparison group (37 students receiving sleep sensor feedback), experimental group one (E1; 38 students receiving sleep sensor feedback and adopting MCG), and experimental group two (E2; 39 students receiving sleep sensor feedback, adopting MCG, and taking a social cognitive-based course). The empirical results suggest that the use of sleep sensor feedback and the MCG (E1 and E2) effectively improved the sleep behaviors of vocational students. In fact, inclusion of the mobile sensor with feedback on sleep quality was sufficient to provide improvement in both sleep and academic outcomes for all students. These results demonstrate the promising potential of mobile community-based technological interventions for improving sleep hygiene, relieving insomnia daytime sleepiness, when integrated with either traditional or social cognitive-based sleep courses.

However, force sensor-based approaches are not cost-effective. In order to cope with this problem so as to facilitate the implementation of compliance control, this paper aims to compare various observer-based force-sensorless approaches for implementing impedance control of collaborative robot manipulators. Different observer-based approaches, such as the generalized momentum approach, the extended state observer, the modified extended state observer, and the closed-loop disturbance observer are used in this paper to estimate the contact force. Several impedance control experiments conducted on a 6-DOF robot manipulator are used to assess the performances of the aforementioned observer-based approaches. Experimental results indicate that the modified extended state observer exhibits the best performance on contact force estimation among all the tested observer-based approaches. ? 2020 IEEE.",disturbance observer; human-robot interaction; impedance control; robot manipulator,Cost effectiveness; Embedded systems; Flexible manipulators; Human robot interaction; Industrial manipulators; Modular robots; Robot applications; State estimation; Collaborative robots; Contact force estimations; Contact forces; Disturbance observer; Extended state observer; Force sensorless; Impedance control; Performance comparison; Compliance control,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098725281

However, biologists do not know how to measure the robustness quantitatively. Therefore, it is needed to develop a quantitative robustness measure for GRNs. In this study, the dynamics of a GRN is described by a set of nonlinear coupled differential equations in power-law formalism. Based on this mathematical representation, a quantitative robustness measure for GRNs is proposed. Using the proposed robustness measure, one can quantitatively compute how the steady state of a GRN is affected by small changes of the interactions between genes due to mutations or diseases. Moreover, the proposed robustness measure could be used to quantitatively compare the robustness of different GRN topologies, which has very important applications in studying the evolution of the robustness of GRNs. In addition, the proposed robustness measure is useful for designing a robust GRN, which has very important applications in synthetic biology. ? 2020, MUK Publications and Distribution.

Our encoder accounts for these requirements by separately recording the spatial details and the spectral information, both of which essentially require only simple averaging operators. Our measurement strategy naturally induces a reconstruction criterion that can be elegantly interpreted as a well-known fusion problem in satellite remote sensing, allowing the adoption of a convex optimization method for simple and fast decoding. Our method, termed spatial/spectral compressed encoder (SPACE), is experimentally evaluated on real hyperspectral data, showing superior efficacy in terms of both sampling rate and reconstruction accuracy. ? 2020 IEEE.",Compressed sensing; Hyperspectral imagery; Measurement strategy; Spaceborne sensors systems,Compressed sensing; Convex optimization; Remote sensing; Satellite communication systems; Satellites; Signal encoding; Spectroscopy; Convex optimization methods; Hyper-spectral imageries; Limited communication; Measurement strategies; Reconstruction accuracy; Reconstruction criteria; Satellite communications; Satellite remote sensing; Array processing,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092445113

Therefore, the integral nonlinearity (INL), and differential nonlinearity (DNL) are diminished, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNDR) is enhanced. Besides, Detect-and-Skip (DAS) is adopted to decrease capacitor switching power and capacitor mismatch. The proof-of-concept prototype was fabricated in TSMC 40-nm CMOS technology.

The tri-cation organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite film was prepared by a one-step solution process in which the amount of Cs was varied to modify the property of FA0.75MA0.25PbI3. It was found that the microstructure and defect properties of films are highly dependent on the contents of FA, MA, and Cs in the perovskite. The results found that 5% CsI doping is the optimized condition for improving the quality of FA0.75MA0.25PbI3, forming a high quality tri-cation perovskite film with a smooth, uniform, stable and robust crystalline grain structure. The resistive switching on/off ratio of the (FA0.75MA0.25)0.95Cs0.05PbI3 device is greater than 103 owing to the improved thin-film quality. Moreover, for the 5% CsI doped FA0.75MA0.25PbI3 films, the endurance and the stability of retention are better than the non-doped film. The improved microstructure and memory properties are attributed to the balance stress of FA/MA/Cs with different ionic size.

These two functions usually encounter large output voltage transient, which is hard to be quickly settled. Charge balance control is one of the prior choices that enables the converter to operate at its optimal charge/discharge slew rate so as to achieve fast transient response. The effectiveness of the optimal performance generally requires precise knowledge of the circuit parameters for charge balance computation. However, parameter drifting due to the manufacturing process may affect the performance, which is hard to implement a power integrated circuit (IC) for wide range applications. Different from the original approaches, this paper proposes an auto-tuning charge balance control (AT-CBC) to optimize load transient response and DVS of the buck converter. The auto-tuning mechanism can save the preknowledge of the output filter and avoid complex calculation in digital control. The function of AT-CBC is validated by a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) controlled buck converter. Experimental result shows that the output voltage can be settled within 3 μs for the 750-mA load step transient. For the 0.3-V DVS transient, the output voltage can be settled within 4 μs. ? 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",auto-tuning; charge balance control (CBC); DC-DC converter; digital control; dynamic voltage scaling (DVS),Digital control systems; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Power quality; Transient analysis; Tuning; Voltage scaling; Autotuning; Charge balances; Digital control; Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS); Fast transient response; Load transient response; Manufacturing process; Optimal performance; DC-DC converters,"Chang-Chien, L.-R.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: leren@ee.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079713222

In contrast to a traditional enzymatic glucose sensor, the non-enzymatic glucose sensor is reusable, enabling its long-term use by patients with diabetes. Although the reduction voltages of Ni and Au are considerably different, the Ni-Au alloy nanowires used in the sensor were fabricated successfully via the adjustment of the electrodeposition parameters. The Ni-Au alloy nanowires exhibited a high crystallinity and a uniform arrangement with an average height of 750 nm. The Ni-Au alloy glucose sensor exhibited a linear range of 0-3 mM, a sensitivity of 1893 μA/mMcm2, and a detection limit of 1 μM. Superior selectivity and stability over at least 30 days were also observed. The characteristics show that Ni-Au alloy nanowires have excellent glucose-sensing performance compared with single noble metal nanowires.

In a hybrid network with both traditional network domains and software-defined networking (SDN) domains, the simultaneous inter-domain routing information exchange requires collaboration among different autonomous systems (ASes). However, the rigid routing policies of the conventional BGP are sometimes inadequate to meet the demand of applications with low-latency requirements like augmented reality (AR). In this paper, we propose a Latency Reduction Software-Defined BGP (LRSD-BGP) framework to reduce the latency in inter-domain initial link setup. Furthermore, a controller-to-controller (C2C) communication module is designed to accelerate the routing link establishment procedure of inter-domain traffic by pre-allocating and installing routing paths for the AS in the next hop.

This paper reports a silver-based surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensor with a very low detection limit for adenine molecules. Clusters of closely packed silver nanoparticles on surfaces of discrete ball-like copper bumps partially covered with graphene are deposited by immersion in silver nitrate. These clusters of silver nanoparticles exhibit abundant nanogaps between nanoparticles, where plasmonic coupling induces very high local electromagnetic fields. Silver nanoparticles growing perpendicularly on ball-like copper bumps exhibit surfaces of large curvature, where electromagnetic field enhancement is high. Between discrete ball-like copper bumps, the local electromagnetic field is low. Silver is not deposited on the low-field surface area. Adenine molecules interact with silver by both electrostatic and functional groups and exhibit low surface diffusivity on silver surface. Adenine molecules are less likely to adsorb on low-field sensor surface without silver. Therefore, adenine molecules have a high probability of adsorbing on silver surface of high local electric fields and contribute to the measured Raman scattering signal strength. We demonstrated SERS sensors made of clusters of silver nanoparticles deposited on discrete ball-like copper bumps with very a low detection limit for detecting adenine water solution of a concentration as low as 10?11 M. ? 2020 by the authors.

To achieve this goal, the H-cups system uses three important components. Firstly, paired cups are embedded with accelerometers and gyro sensors to transmit the three-dimensional acceleration and angular signals to a motion recognizer application. This application is designed on an Android phone. The sensors then receive the remotely recognized motions and flash a specific color on the local cup's RGB-LED via Bluetooth. Secondly, the application considers holding-cup motion recognition from the cup based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and sends the local recognized motion through an intermediate server to transmit to the remote paired cup via the internet. Finally, an intermediate server is established and used to exchange and forward the recognized holding-cup motions between two paired cups, in which five holding-cup motions, including drinking, horizontal shaking, vertical shaking, swaying and raising toasts are proposed and recognized by LSTM. The experimental results indicate that the recognition accuracy of the holding-cup motion can reach 97.3% when using our method.

However, the spatial resolutions of Sentinel-2 images are different across its spectral bands, including four bands with a resolution of 10 m, six bands with a resolution of 20 m, and three bands with a resolution of 60 m. To facilitate the effectiveness of analyzing these images, super-resolving of the low-/medium-resolution bands to a higher resolution is desired. As in any image restoration inverse problems, we exploit image self-similarity, a commonly observed property in natural images, which underlies the state-of-The-Art techniques, e.g., in image denoising. However, the design of self-similarity priors in nondiagonal inverse problems is challenging; often, a denoiser based on self-similarity is plugged into the iterations of an algorithm, without a guarantee of convergence in general. In this article, for the first time, we introduce a convex and scene-Adapted regularizer built explicitly on a self-similarity graph directly learned from the Sentinel-2 images. We then develop a fast algorithm, termed Sentinel-2 super-resolution via scene-Adapted self-similarity (SSSS).

In this paper, a novel forecasting strategy that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a salp swarm algorithm (SSA) is proposed to forecast PV power output. First, the historical PV power data and associated weather information are classified into five weather types, such as rainy, heavy cloudy, cloudy, light cloudy and sunny. The CNN classification is then used to determine the prediction for the next day's weather type. Five models of CNN regression are established to accommodate the prediction for different weather types. Each CNN regression is optimized using a salp swarm algorithm (SSA) to tune the best parameter. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, comparisons were made to the SSA based support vector machine (SVM-SSA) and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM-SSA) methods. The proposed method was tested on a PV power generation system with a 500 kWp capacity located in south Taiwan. The results showed that the proposed CNN-SSA could accommodate the actual generation pattern better than the SVM-SSA and LSTM-SSA methods. ? 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

First, an equivalent mathematical model of the singular analog system is presented to simulate the time response of continuous-time linear singular analog systems to arbitrary inputs via the model conversion method. Then, for the unknown singular analog system, it constructs a linear quadratic analog trackerwith state feedback and feed-forward gains based on the off-lineOKIDmethod. Furthermore, it extends the designmethodology of the EID estimator for strictly proper regular systemswith unknownmatched-mismatched input and output disturbances to proper regular systems. It is important to mention that the newly developed modified functional observer for proper systems is used to estimate the unknown EID of singular analog systems and that the constraints on the dimensions of unknown disturbances can be eliminated by using the newly proposed EID estimation method. The contributions of this paper can be listed as follows: (1) based on both the OKID method and the discrete-to-continuous model conversion, the simulation of the time responses of the continuous-time linear singular models (which are not feasible using existing MATLAB toolboxes) become feasible; (2) for effective control of the unknown singular analog system, an off-line OKID method is proposed to design an LQAT with state feedback and feed-forward gains; and (3) based on the newly developed modified functional observer for the reduced-order proper regular system, the original EID estimator in the literature is newly extended to estimate the EID from the unknown strictly proper singular analog system, without the original dimensional constraints of the disturbances.

In a GNSS Reflectometry (GNSS-R) system, a set of delay-Doppler maps (DDMs) related to scattered GNSS signals is formed and serves as a measurement of ocean wind speed and roughness. The design of the DDM receiver involves a trade-off between computation/communication complexity and the effectiveness of data retrieval. A fine-resolution DDM reveals more information in data retrieval while consuming more resources in terms of onboard processing and downlinking. As a result, existing missions typically use a compressed or low-resolution DDM as a data product, and a high-resolution DDM is processed for special purposes such as calibration. In this paper, a deep learning, super resolution algorithm is developed to construct a high-resolution DDM based on a low-resolution DDM. This may potentially enhance the data retrieval results with no impact on the instrument design. The proposed method is applied to process the DDM products disseminated by the Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) and the effectiveness of wind speed retrieval is demonstrated. ? 2020 by the authors.",Delay-doppler map (DDM); Global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R); Single image super-resolution (SISR); Very-deep super-resolution (VDSR); Wind speed retrieval,Communication satellites; Deep learning; Economic and social effects; Global positioning system; Optical resolving power; Reflection; Reflectometers; Remote sensing; Salinity measurement; Storms; Wind; Delay-doppler maps; Reflectometry; Single images; Super resolution; Wind speed; Search engines,"Juang, J.-C.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: juang@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082305757

The relationship between applied voltage and electromagnetic torque is first analyzed and the effect of the voltage and flux linkage on torque ripple is discussed. Then, the new method is developed to reduce torque ripple by giving low-fluctuation voltage commands to the voltage source inverter. The magnitude of the voltage command is calculated by avoiding the effect of flux linkage angle that can be estimated inaccurately during motor operation. Therefore, the fluctuation of the voltage command can be significantly reduced. In order to validate the proposed method, Simulink is first used for simulation and the performance of the proposed method is evaluated. It is found that the torque ripple can be substantially reduced while keeping a low switching frequency and improving system response. Then, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) technique is applied to test the developed algorithm that is written into a Texas Instruments microcontroller.

Diamond seeding is not a diamond nucleation process. Bias enhanced nucleation (BEN) is the most effective means of heterogeneous nucleation of diamond for CVD diamond. It is based on a negative biasing voltage between the substrate and the diamond CVD plasma to accelerate positive ions from the plasma to bombard the substrate.

Op-amp sharing is used to reduce the quantity of amplifiers because they dominate the entire power consumption of the HPSDM. Moreover, the amplitude of the ECG varies from person to person; hence, programmable feed-forward coefficients are used to adjust the dynamic range of HPSDM to obtain high resolution across users. This technique is implemented using the 0.18 μm standard CMOS process. Measurement results reveal that the proposed HPSDM has a signal-to-noise and distortion (SNDR) of 54.5 dB and a power of 2.25 μW under a 1.2 V supply voltage to achieve the figure of merit of 12.96 pJ/conv. In terms of other settings, the proposed HPSDM has an SNDR of 64.8 dB and a power of 5.2 μW under a 1.8 V supply voltage to achieve the figure of merit of 9.15 pJ/conv.

Experimental results reveal that a significant speedup in terms of operation reduction can be achieved by adopting the proposed schemes as compared to existing works assuming a comparable security level.

To efficiently manage the power demand, numbers of power modules are integrated together to form a power management unit (PMU). Since each power module has its own spec, the controller inside the power module is usually independent. The independent controller with its own signal process scheme definitely occupies certain circuit area, which is not area efficient as the number of power module increases inside the PMU. Therefore, a controller sharing concept is proposed for saving the circuit area. The controller sharing solution is stemmed from the time multiplexing concept. Based on the discrete feature of the digital control, several hardware segments of the controller can be shared for different power modules without affecting individual performance. Detail of the controller sharing model in time domain is built on MATLAB Simulink software to verify the feasibility of the controller sharing mechanism. ? 2020 IEEE",Pipeline ADC; Power management unit (PMU),Controllers; Digital control systems; Electric power systems; MATLAB; Power management; Signal processing; Digital control; Individual performance; Matlab-Simulink software; Power management unit; Power management units (PMU); Sharing mechanism; Time multiplexing; Voltage support; Power control,"Liu, C.-W.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: N2897123@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85109279067

Previous studies have shown that SO2 has a serious impact on human health, in particularly on respiratory problems. By taking Taiwan as the study area, this study aimed to assess the spatial-temporal variability of SO2 using a neural network-based land use regression model. Daily SO2 observations during 2000 to 2018 were obtained from 73 monitoring stations established by Taiwan Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Totally, around 0.48 million observations were collected for our analysis. Several databases were used to collect the spatial predictor variables, including EPA environmental resources database, meteorological database, land-use inventory, landmark database, digital road network map, DTM, MODIS NDVI dataset, and thermal power plant distribution database. To establish the integrated approach, conventional land-use regression (LUR) was first used to identify the important predictors variables. After that, a deep neural network (DNN) algorithm was applied to fit the prediction model. The results showed that, the adj-R2 obtained from the conventional LUR approach was 0.37. Of the 15 variables selected by the stepwise variable selection procedure, PM10, nearest thermal power plants, and NO2 are important variables that increased the SO2 exposures with the explanatory ability up to 18%, 6%n and 4%, respectively. Compared to the conventional LUR approach, by combining DNN algorithm can improve the model explanatory ability up to 21% (adj-R2=0.59). The results of 10-fold cross validation and external data verification confirmed that the value of the adj-R2 after combining both approaches increased from 0.37 to 0.59, and RMSE decreased from 2.48 ppm to 2.01 Findings of this study confirm that the combination of LUR, and DNN algorithm can improve the prediction performance level and the explanatory abilities in assessing spatial-temporal variability of SO2 exposure. ? 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: ""Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future"".

First, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify valuable parts of the data and further reduce the dimensions of the data. The cumulative proportion of the top five major components was 99.89%. The multilayer perceptron network (MLP) method was then used to extract characteristics included in the data, and the structure of the network was designed for the exploration of how data developed as the dimensions increased or decreased. As such, the model was established to first explore (high dimensional) and then develop (low dimensional) data. After training and learning, the models could segregate the representative attributes and numbers, and the characteristic data were then used as classifiers through transfer learning techniques using support vector machines. To verify the proposed method, the experiment performed k-fold cross-validation 50 times on average. Experimental results verified the proposed method with 10-fold cross-validation using the dataset of Manuel Gomes from the University Hospital Centre of Coimbra, and an accuracy of 86.97% was achieved. The results indicate that the proposed series of processes and methods can effectively and powerfully examine the incidence of breast cancer. Furthermore, the data processed using only the PCA method as well as the characteristics extracted through the PCA method then combined with MLP after learning were analyzed.

In this study, to analyze the overload data on expressways and highways in China, we developed a machine learning model by comparing the performances of cluster analysis, backpropagation neural network (BPNN), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), and wavelet neural network (WNN) in analyzing global and local time series overload data. In a case study, our results revealed the trends of overloading on highways in Jiangsu Province. Given sufficient data, BPNN performed better than GRNN and WNN. As the amount of training data increased, GRNN performed better, but the runtime increased. WNN had the shortest runtime among the three methods and could reflect the future trends of the overload rate in the monthly data prediction of overload.

To address these two challenges, here we present Yeast Quantitative Features Comparator (YQFC) that can directly compare various quantitative features between two yeast gene lists. In YQFC, we comprehensively collected and processed 85 quantitative features from the yeast literature and yeast databases. For each quantitative feature, YQFC provides three statistical tests (t-test, U test and KS test) to test whether this quantitative feature is statistically different between the two input yeast gene lists. The distinct quantitative features identified by YQFC may help researchers to study the underlying molecular mechanisms that differentiate the two input yeast gene lists. We believe that YQFC is a useful tool to expedite the biological research that uses high-throughput omics technologies. Database URL: http://cosbi2.ee.ncku.edu.tw/YQFC/ ? 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) schemes have been proposed as a potential means of addressing these issues and have attracted great attention in recent years. Most previous studies on ABE focus on issues such as the revocation mechanism, multi-authority, the access structure design, and traceability. However, very few studies consider the storage efficiency problem and the present study proposes a novel data deduplication scheme based on ciphertext-policy ABE with convergent encryption and block-level data. The scheme can be deployed in third-party semi-trusted environments, and not only provides flexible, fine-grained access control over encrypted data, but also allows for the in-line elimination of redundancies in order to save cloud storage space. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme has an acceptable computational overhead and provides a promising solution for real-world data cloud storage and access scenarios. ? 2020 Taiwan Academic Network Management Committee.

Scholars have applied the CSA to obtain efficient solutions to certain function and combinatorial optimization problems. Another popular and powerful method with several real-world applications (e.g., energy, finance, marketing, and medical imaging) is fuzzy clustering. The fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm is a critical fuzzy clustering approach given its efficiency and implementation easily. However, the FCM algorithm can be easily trapped in the local optima. To solve this data clustering problem, this study proposes a hybrid fuzzy clustering algorithm combines the CSA and a fireworks algorithm.

Recently, the leaking of images such as identification and driver's licenses catches much attention. The trend towards secure computation has been widely discussed, especially asymmetric scalar-product-preserving encryption (ASPE) and homomorphic encryption (HE). Although ASPE have ability to encrypt and determine the similarity between ciphertexts efficiently, it is not a practical methodology due to its assumption that the users are fully trusted in real world and it also may have key leakage problem. Contrary to ASPE, HE can execute addition and multiplication in the encrypted domain and solve key leakage problem. Hence, in this paper, we combine the opinions of HE and ASPE to propose new privacy-preserving content-based image retrieval with key confidentiality scheme against the attacks from data owner, cloud server and users. Our privacy preserving image retrieval scheme is developed under strong threat model that is close to real world. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one that developing scheme under the assumption that all the entities involved in privacy-preserving image retrieval system are semi-trusted. Our scheme ensures the confidentiality of key and privacy of query information at the same time. In addition, we provide a lightweight verification to check whether the search query is fake or not. Finally, the experiment results show that the computation overheads and search precision are acceptable at the same time. ? 2013 IEEE.",homomorphic encryption; privacy-preserving computation; Secure image retrieval,Content based retrieval; Cryptography; Digital storage; Storage as a service (STaaS); Trusted computing; Computation overheads; Content based image retrieval; Ho-momorphic encryptions; Image retrieval systems; Privacy preserving; Query information; Secure cloud storages; Secure computation; Search engines,"Liu, C.-G.; Department of Applied Informatics and Multimedia, Taiwan; 電子郵件: chgliu@mail.cnu.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087800750

So far, most waveform-mapping-based SE methods have focused on single-channel tasks. In this article, we propose a novel fully convolutional network (FCN) with Sinc and dilated convolutional layers (termed SDFCN) for multichannel SE that operates in the time domain. We also propose an extended version of SDFCN, called the residual SDFCN (termed rSDFCN).

The proposed network exploits the rich information extracted from the transform domain to reconstruct more accurate high-resolution images. In addition, to reap the benefits from both residual network (ResNet) and densely convolutional network (DenseNet) topologies, we use dual-path blocks as the basic building blocks which allow feature re-use while ensuring the ability to continue extracting new features.

In the multi-GNSS era, signals from different constellation, at different frequency, and under different modulation are available to facilitate such applications.

This article proposes a framework to synergize BPSK and BOC signals for GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) applications by establishing a channel response function to model the scattering phenomena and a commutative diagram to illustrate the interrelationship among direct and reflected signals under different modulations.

It utilizes a weighted filter and calculates the brightness values of an image based on the adjusted image. The brightness values are processed to either reduce or increase the brightness values of the points. To further improve the quality of an image, the algorithm implements a block-based pixel processing as opposed to a per image frame processing.

In order to operate RRAM in an ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopic regime, the spectral transparency of electrodes and reliable device performance are keys to ensuring its continual applicability. Among the materials considered, nickel oxide (NiO) potentially has a broad perspective in optical applications due to their relatively wide bandgap, high mobility, high transparency, remarkably good electrical and optical characteristics. It is foreseeable in the future that the unique applicability of RRAM in UV will make its headway as a key component in many optoelectronic displaying products. The present study focuses on using Radio Frequency Magnetron Sputtering method to prepare NiO active layer and indium tin oxide (ITO) top electrode for the realization of RRAM devices and their current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics are subsequently evaluated with and without the irradiation of ultraviolet light. Specifically, a series of reliability tests show that the fabricated memories have endured up to 100 switching cycles and the current contrast ratio between high (HRS) and low (LRS) resistance state at 0.1V has achieved more than two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the retention time measurement has also demonstrated that the memory storage capability of these RRAMs remains in excellent operating condition after surviving more than 10,000 seconds of the test. Major attention is concentrated on finding out a correlation between the UV responsivity and switching characteristics for NiO RRAMs biased at low voltage. We found that the memory states associated with the RRAM of the smallest feature sizes could be toggled relatively easily by UV irradiation at the smallest size. ? COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The transparent ITO and NiO layers are deposited by radio-frequency sputtering technique, while the bus waveguides in LiNbO3 is achieved by a proton-exchange method. The ReRAM-based microdisk resonator thus designed and fabricated have dual functionality of memory and optical spectral filtering capabilities. When the ReRAM microdisk resonator is electronically set at different memory states, that is, ReRAM is alternatively set in high-resistance state (HRS) and low-resistance state (LRS), the corresponding spectral shifts detected at both through and drop ports are noticeable different, when compared with those obtained before and after subjecting the ReRAM to a required forming process. Specifically, the spectral shift associated with the LRS state of ReRAM between the through and drop port terminal is around 4.4 nm, as compared to the spectral shift of approximately 1.7 nm that is associated with the HRS state of ReRAM between the same two terminals. The aforementioned characteristics of selective light wave filtering can be selectively tuned by varying the ReRAM device dimensions. The adoption of the different thin-film materials for the ReRAM fabrication may also play an important role in spectral tuning. Most important of all, because of different spectral shifts observed, the particular memory state of ReRAM could possibly and uniquely be interrogated by an optical means. The resultant discovery opens a new pathway in the future to the realization of one of the new optical memory devices. ? COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Due to the sparse nature of mmWave channel, several users may choose the same beam as the strongest one, leading to severe intra-beam interference (intra-BI). Although intra-BI can be mitigated through digital precoding, the required number of RF chains for fulfilling massive connectivity becomes large. By applying non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and properly allocating transmit power to each beam and user, the sum rate can be maximized using a smaller number of RF chains. However, the power allocated to each user depends on that allocated to other users within the same beam. Since the joint beam selection and power allocation problem contains a non-convex objective function with a large set of coupled and mixed integer variables, direct solutions may not exist particularly when both the number of users and antennas are large. In this work, we decompose the aforementioned problem into two subproblems, where the beam selection sub-problem is first solved under an equal power allocation. The outcome of beam selection is then used as the input to the power allocation sub-problem. For both subproblems, we develop numerous efficient algorithms to find the active beam set and the user power allocation, respectively. The notions of embedded methods from machine learning and that of intelligent searching from metaheuristics are adopted in our work as the key ingredient for algorithm constructions. Numerical results demonstrate that in the region of large user population, the proposed beam selection and power allocation algorithms can effectively improve the sum rate using a less number of RF chains in comparison with some existing solutions. ? 2013 IEEE.",Beam selection; metaheuristic; millimeter wave; non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA); power allocation,5G mobile communication systems; Energy efficiency; Machine learning; Population statistics; Wireless networks; Beam selection; Equal power allocation; Metaheuristic; Millimeter waves (mmwave); Multiple access; Non-convex objective functions; Power allocation algorithms; Power allocations; Millimeter waves,"Liu, K.-H.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: khliu@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082658893

Conventional gait pattern generators usually utilize the ideal Zero Moment Point (ZMP) to plan the trajectory of the Center of Mass (CoM), along with a cycloid to generate steps. However, pre-planned gait patterns cannot deal with unexpected situations, especially instances when the robot experiences an unknown force. Therefore, we propose a dynamic gait pattern generator that leverages the Virtual Force Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (VFLIPM) to adjust the trajectory of the CoM, and which detects balance status by estimating the trajectory of the ZMP using eight high-precision load cell pressure sensors mounted onto the robot's soles. We integrate an accelerometer and the pressure sensors through a fuzzy controller to instantly respond to external forces and generate a suitable gait pattern. When the robot is pushed suddenly, it first adopts a pre-planned gait pattern to replace the current gait. At the same time, the fuzzy controller calculates the recovery gait, with appropriate strides and lean angles to absorb the impact. The proposed method is implemented on the teen-sized humanoid robot, David Junior II, for the Push Recovery event at RoboCup. David Junior II endured a hit with potential energy during walking, which is 1.3 times more robust than when standing. ? 2013 IEEE.",Center of pressure (CoP); dynamic gait balance; humanoid robots; linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM); push recovery; real-time biped gait generation; sensor fusion; zero moment point (ZMP),Anthropomorphic robots; Pendulums; Potential energy; Pressure sensors; Recovery; Trajectories; Biped gait; Center of pressure; Dynamic gaits; Humanoid robot; Inverted pendulum model; Push recoveries; Sensor fusion; Zero moment point; Gait analysis,"Li, T.-H.S.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: thsli@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081117486

Learning social influence between users on social networks has beextensively studied in a decade. Many models were proposed to model the microscopic diffusion process or to directly predict the final diffusion results. However, most of them need expensive Monte Carlo simulations to estimate diffusion results and some of them just predict the size of the spread via regression techniques, where people who will adopt the information becomes unknown. In this work, we regard the prediction of final influence diffusion results in a social network as a classification problem to avoid expensive simulations with knowing the final adopters. Furthermore, we propose a community-based convolutional neural network to capture the information of local structure with the aforementioned network. The proposed model is referred to as the Social Influence Learning on Community-based Convolutional Neural Network, SIL-CCNN. In the experiment, SIL-CCNN shows the promising results in both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conventional constant on-Time control is hampered by input current distortion, leading to high THD. To achieve high PF and low THD, a digital switching frequency limiter with quasi-resonant control was proposed. In addition, owing to the turn-off delay of the MOSFET and propagation delay of the feedback signals, a primary-side-controlled flyback converter experiences poor line regulation. To achieve superior line regulation, delay compensation was proposed and analyzed. A digital controller was realized using a field-programmable gate array and was applied to an input voltage of 90-264~V_{\mathrm {ac}} and an output current of 1 A in a hardware prototype to verify the feasibility of the proposed control solution.

Recently, Hinton et al. proposed capsule neural networks to resolve the problem of viewpoint variations in image classification tasks. Each capsule is represented as either a vector or a matrix to encode more object information, such as position, size, direction, etc. Instead of detecting specific features, these capsule neural networks search for the most relevant features using an iterative process. Therefore, capsule neural networks require fewer parameters compared to traditional neural networks. Inspired by these advances, we make use of a capsule neural network to exploit more potential features for image SR. In this paper, we develope two frameworks: the Capsule Image Restoration Neural Network (CIRNN) and the Capsule Attention and Reconstruction Neural Network (CARNN), to incorporate capsules into image SR convolutional neural networks. The CIRNN takes advantage of the rich information encoded in the capsules to reconstruct accurate high-resolution images. The CARNN generates SR attention features by utilizing the robust segmentation capability of the capsules. Our experiments show that both frameworks can enhance SR for most testing datasets. The CIRNN performs better than the CARNN and can achieve better performance than other traditional CNN methods with a similar amount of parameters. ? 2013 IEEE.",capsule neural network; convolutional neural network; deep learning; Super resolution,Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Iterative methods; Neural networks; Optical resolving power; Restoration; Convolutional neural network; High resolution image; Image super resolutions; Object information; Potential features; Relevant features; Robust segmentation; Super resolution; Image reconstruction,"Chen, D.-W.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: z40203x@yahoo.com.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078452260

Once this node captured attack occurs, wireless sensor network soon faces various security risks. In this paper, in order to resist node captured attack, we propose a novel authentication information exchange scheme in WSN, which is very different from the previous authentication researches. Our idea is to add an authentication information exchange scheme in previous authentication scheme but not propose new one. We develop this scheme based on the idea of the association scheme of Home GWN and local sensor nodes. In this study, HGWN should contact all local sensor nodes and meanwhile is responsible for performing an authentication information exchange scheme for resisting security risk. In order to prevent the attacker from guessing communication period between HGWN and the sensor, we also design a dynamic contacting mechanism. We give a detail discussion of this scheme and validate it by three ways, security evaluation, BAN logic and performance evaluation, which proves that our authentication information exchange scheme can achieve security features and goals. ? 2013 IEEE.",Authentication protocol; IoT; node captured attack; wireless sensor networks,Authentication; Information dissemination; Network security; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Wireless sensor networks; Association schemes; Authentication information; Authentication protocols; Authentication scheme; Critical technologies; node captured attack; Security evaluation; Wireless sensor node; Internet of things,"Liu, C.-G.; Department of Applied Informatics and Multimedia, Taiwan; 電子郵件: chgliu@mail.cnu.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078423180

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to use NDs as the carriers of CRISPR-Cas9 components designed to introduce the mutation in RS1 gene associated with X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS). ND particles with a diameter of 3 nm were functionalized by carboxylation of the surface and covalently conjugated with fluorescent mCherry protein. Two linear DNA constructs were attached to the conjugated mCherry: one encoded Cas9 endonuclease and GFP reporter, another encoded sgRNA and contained insert of HDR template designed to introduce RS1 c.625C>T mutation. Such nanoparticles were successfully delivered and internalized by human iPSCs and mouse retinas, the efficiency of internalization was significantly improved by mixing with BSA. The delivery of ND particles led to introduction of RS1 c.625C>T mutation in both human iPSCs and mouse retinas. Rs1 gene editing in mouse retinas resulted in several pathological features typical for XLRS, such as aberrant photoreceptor structure. To conclude, our ND-based CRISPR-Cas9 delivery system can be utilized as a tool for creating in vitro and in vivo disease models of XLRS. Statement of significance: X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) is a prevalent hereditary retinal disease, which is caused by mutations in RS1 gene, whose product is important for structural organization of the retina. The recent development of genome editing techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9 significantly improved the prospects for better understanding the pathology and development of treatment for this disease. Firstly, gene editing can allow development of appropriate in vitro and in vivo disease models; secondly, CRISPR-Cas9 can be applied for gene therapy by removing the disease-causative mutation in vivo. The major prerequisite for these approaches is to develop safe and efficient CRISPR-Cas9 delivery system. In this study, we tested specifically modified nanodiamonds for such a delivery system. We were able to introduce Rs1 mutation into the mouse retina and, importantly, observed several XLRS-specific effects. ? 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.",CRISPR-Cas9; iPSC; Mouse retina; Nanodiamond; RS1; XLRS,Controlled drug delivery; Disease control; Gene therapy; Proteins; Targeted drug delivery; CRISPR-cas9; Delivery systems; Disease models; In-vitro; IPSC; Mouse Retina; Nano-diamond particles; RS1; Vitro and in vivo; X-linked retinoschisi; Nanodiamonds; CRISPR associated endonuclease Cas9; nanodiamond; agar gel electrophoresis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; carboxylation; cell viability assay; controlled study; CRISPR Cas system; droplet digital polymerase chain reaction; drug delivery system; expression vector; flow cytometry; fluorescence microscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; gene; gene editing; human; human cell; male; mouse; nonhuman; normal human; photoreceptor; photoreceptor inner segment; retina ganglion cell; retinal inner nuclear layer; retinal outer nuclear layer; retinal outer plexiform layer; retinoschisis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RS1 gene; scanning laser ophthalmoscopy; spectral domain optical coherence tomography; transmission electron microscopy; Western blotting,"Tzeng, Y.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: tzengyo@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075331715

For road driving, the advanced driver assistance system should visually recognize circular prohibition and triangular warning traffic signs to help drivers to grab complete traffic conditions. In this paper, we proposed a low-computation neural assistance system for traffic sign recognition. First, we proposed shaped-based detection algorithms to detect the regions, which are with circle and triangular traffic signs in designated regions of interest. For classification to those detected regions, we then suggest a convolutional neural network to achieve about 5% improvement of top 1 accuracy compared with LeNet model in German traffic sign recognition benchmarks dataset.

In realistic systems, there exist two critical challenges including computing time and detection rate for MOD. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel moving object detection system which contains pre-processing, feature extraction, classification and state machine. The pre-processing contains ROI extraction and skipping low busyness windows, which accelerates the computing time to solve the mentioned problem. To improve the performances, in this paper, the weighted histogram of oriented uniform gradient (WHOUG) with support vector machine (SVM) is proposed to promote the detection accuracy.

Traditional DMSs focus on detecting specific predefined abnormal driving behaviors, such as drowsiness or distracted driving, using generic models trained with the data collected during abnormal driving. However, it is difficult to collect sufficient representative training data to construct generic detection models, which are applicable to all drivers. Consequently, this paper proposes a new personal-based hierarchical DMS (HDMS). During driving, the first layer of the proposed HDMS detects normal and abnormal driving behavior based on normal personal driving models represented by sparse representations. When abnormal driving behavior is detected, the second layer of the HDMS further determines whether the behavior is drowsy driving behavior or distracted driving behavior. The experimental results obtained for three datasets show that the proposed HDMS outperforms existing state-of-the-art DMS methods in detecting normal driving behavior, drowsy driving behavior, and distracted driving behavior. ? 2000-2011 IEEE.",Advanced driver assistance systems; driver monitoring systems; sparse representation; temporal face descriptors,Accidents; Automobile drivers; Monitoring; Vehicles; Computational model; Descriptors; Driver monitoring system; Face; Mouth; Sparse representation; Advanced driver assistance systems,"Huang, C.-R.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: crhuang@nchu.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061325779

The prediction method uses the whale optimization algorithm, discrete wavelet transform, and multiple linear regression model (WOA-DWT-MLR model) to predict both system load and aggregated load of power consumers. WOA is used to optimize the best combination of detail and approximation signals from DWT to construct an optimal MLR model.

Experimentally, under introduced 1% hydrogen/air gas, the studied device shows a high sensing response ratio of 1.03 × 105 at 300 K. In addition, the lowest detecting level of 1 ppm hydrogen at 300 K is obtained. This device also exhibits good high-temperature durability (?573 K) and a high sensing speed. The response (recovery) time constant at 300 K is only 74 (103) sec even under a very low hydrogen concentration of 1 ppm; these time constant values are much smaller than those of palladium metal-based sensors. Under the 1% hydrogen/air, the response (recovery) time constant at 300 K is drastically reduced to 15 (19) sec. Furthermore, in order to improve the feasibility of transmitting the sensing data, the concept of linear differentiation method is employed to eliminate redundant data.

A numerical design model that combined electromagnetic and thermal-fluid analysis was proposed for disclosing the detailed temperature distributions of each component in an electric motor. The thermal fluid analysis implemented ANSYS-Fluent code to unravel the thermal field of the interior permanent magnet synchronous electric motor fitted with a smooth or novel spirally twisted channel in the cooling water jacket of a stator with and without shaft cooling. In accordance with the thermal powers converted from the various electromagnetic losses of the electric motor, the complex heat conduction model with realistic thermal boundary conditions was formulated. Initially, the turbulent flow structures and channel averaged Nusselt numbers of the spiral channels without and with the sectional twist were comparatively examined for acquiring the convective thermal boundary conditions in the water jacket. With the high thermal conductivity of the aluminum water jacket, the heat-transfer improvements from the smooth-spiral-channel conditions by using the twisted spiral channel were effective for reducing the average temperatures by about 10% but less effective for altering the characteristic thermal field in the water jacket. At 1290 < Dn < 6455 or 5000 < Re < 25,000 for the spiral channel flows, the channel average Nusselt numbers ratios between the smooth and twisted spiral channels were elevated to 1.18–1.09 but decreased with the increase of Dn or Re. A set of heat-transfer correlations for estimating the Nusselt numbers of Taylor flow in the rotor-to-stator air gap was newly devised from the data available in the literature. While the cooling effectiveness of the water jacket and shaft was boosted by the sectional twists along the spiral channel of the water jacket, the presence of Taylor flow in the annual air gap prohibited the effective rotor-to-stator heat transmission, leading to hot spots in the rotor. By way of airflow cooling through the rotating hollow shaft, the high temperatures in the rotor were considerably moderated. As the development of Taylor flow between the rotor and stator was inevitable, the development of active or passive rotor cooling schemes was necessary for extending the power density of an electric motor. Unlike the previous thermal circuit or lumped-parameter thermal model that predicted the overall temperatures of motor components, the present coupled electromagnetic and thermal-fluid model can reveal the detailed temperature distributions in an electric motor to probe the local hot spots of each component in order to avoid overheating at the early design stage. ? 2019 by the authors.

Linear HU via variational minimum volume (MV) regularization has recently received considerable attention in the remote sensing and machine learning areas, mainly owing to its robustness against the absence of pure pixels. We put some popular linear HU formulations under a unifying framework, which involves a data-fitting term and an MV-based regularization term, and collectively solve it via a nonconvex optimization. As the former and the latter terms tend, respectively, to expand (reducing the data-fitting errors) and to shrink the simplex enclosing the measured spectra, it is critical to strike a balance between those two terms. To the best of our knowledge, the existing methods find such balance by tuning a regularization parameter manually, which has little value in unsupervised scenarios. In this paper, we aim at selecting the regularization parameter automatically by exploiting the fact that a too large parameter overshrinks the volume of the simplex defined by the endmembers, making many data points be left outside of the simplex and hence inducing a large data-fitting error, while a sufficiently small parameter yields a large simplex making data-fitting error very small. Roughly speaking, the transition point happens when the simplex still encloses the data cloud but there are data points on all its facets. These observations are systematically formulated to find the transition point that, in turn, yields a good parameter. The competitiveness of the proposed selection criterion is illustrated with simulated and real data. ? 1980-2012 IEEE.",Craig criterion; hyperspectral images (HSIs); nonconvex optimization; spectral unmixing,Data handling; Errors; Parameterization; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Transition flow; Craig criterion; Hyperspectral unmixing; Nonconvex optimization; Observation matrix; Regularization parameters; Regularization terms; Selection criteria; Spectral unmixing; Matrix algebra; machine learning; numerical method; optimization; parameter estimation; pixel; remote sensing; spectral analysis; unsupervised classification; volume,"Zhuang, L.; Instituto de Telecomunicac?es, Portugal; 電子郵件: lina.zhuang@lx.it.pt",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075667290

However, in many application, the events may span over multiple time points and the relations among events are also important. Time interval-based pattern mining is proposed to mine the interesting patterns of events that span over some time periods and also by considering the relations among events. Previous works of time interval-based pattern mining focused on the relations between events without considering the duration of each event. However, the same event with different time duration may cause different results. In this work, we propose two algorithms, SARA and SARS, for mining frequent time interval-based events with duration, TIED, patterns. TIED patterns not only keep the relations between two events but also reveal the time periods when each event happens and ends. For the performance evaluation, we propose a naive algorithm and modify a previous algorithm along with the implementation of SARA and SARS. The experimental results show that SARA and SARS are more efficient in terms of execution time and memory usage than other two algorithms. Moreover, we extend this work by considering utility value or importance of event in each time stamp. Therefore, we propose another new High Utility Time Interval-based Events with Duration, HU-TIED, pattern. HU-TIED incorporates the concept of utility pattern mining and TIED pattern mining. We design an algorithm, LMSpan, to mine top-K HU-TIED patterns. For the performance evaluation, we design a baseline algorithm, GenerateNCheck to compare with LMSpan.

The benefits of Al-doped ZnO nanosheet pH sensor were high sensitivity, good long-term usage, good flexible property, and requirement of a small amount of test liquid, which could make the sensors viable candidates for practical applications.

It is of utmost importance for utility companies to operate at maximum efficiency and minimise voltage deviation and power losses. Distributed network reconfiguration (DNR) and integration of distributed generation (DG) are commonly employed to mitigate power loss and voltage deviation. DNR is a complex combinatorial problem which requires radiality verification. Implicit radiality verification increases computational overhead and may lead to local optima. Whereas, improper selection of DG size poses direct consequences on the distribution network mainly on increased voltage deviation and power losses. Therefore, simultaneous optimal integration of DNR and DG is considered in this study to improve the overall performance of the distribution network. Explicit radiality verification is proposed based on Hamming dataset approach to significantly reduce the search space and the computational time, as well as to improve the quality of the solution. Subsequently, firefly algorithm is applied to attain near-optimal solution for NR and DG size. Four cases are considered to validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique including investigation on small, medium, and large-scale distribution network. The results show that the proposed technique is able to consistently attain near optimal-solutions. ?

Although RL has been applied to many research fields, there are difficulties when implementing it in some real world applications. One difficulty is the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation for the agent of RL in choosing a proper action. An improper action may lead to a learning failure or an increase in learning cost. Another difficulty is that the learning agent of RL needs to interact with the environment to attain a real-time reward/penalty; however, the learning time spent in the interaction process may be too long. In order to overcome the aforementioned difficulties, this paper proposes an approach that employs a personalized recommendation system to provide a feedforward candidate action for RL to implement self-adaptive learning through teaching.

Nowadays, DTC has been widely used in industrial applications thanks to its simple structure and high dynamic performance. However, hysteresis controllers cause high torque ripple and deteriorate control performance. In this paper, hysteresis controllers and traditional DTC switching table are replaced by a model predictive controller to achieve an online optimization for the required driving voltage space vector. Furthermore, a pre-selective process is designed to filter out the inappropriate voltage vectors and reduce computational burden caused by the eight basic voltage space vectors. Finally, an optimal duty ratio modulation method is proposed to determine appropriate zero voltage vector and the duty ratio of the selected voltage vector in each control period for torque ripple reduction. By implementing the proposed DTC, torque ripple is reduced and the approximated switching frequency can be minimized to retain the advantages of a traditional DTC; meanwhile, the torque response is still quick.

Compared with the same level traditional inverter topologies, this new topology uses fewer components and achieves voltage balance without any voltagebalancing circuit or complex control method, so smaller size of circuit and higher power density can be realized. The total harmonic distortion of the output voltage is low. The control scheme is implemented by TMS320F28035. Finally, a 2 kW laboratory prototype inverter with input voltage 380 V is proposed to verify the theoretical analysis and the performance. ? 2019 IEEE.",coupled inductor; self-balancing; seven-level inverter,Electric inductors; Topology; Complex control method; Coupled inductor; Inverter topologies; Output voltages; Self-balancing; Seven-level; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Voltage-balancing circuits; Electric inverters,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082386275

Four configurations designed and studied include ring, segmented, modular, and asymmetric magnet shapes. The rotor is often manufactured by pre-magnetized permanent magnets (PMs), in which the magnets would be damaged when being assembled into the sleeve due to compressive force and magnetic force in some manufacturing process. Therefore, post assembly magnetization is applied to magnetize the PMs after the rotor being assembled into the sleeve. The effectiveness of this technique for different rotor configurations is firstly investigated. Then, the harmonic spectrums of back EMF, air-gap flux density, and cogging torque are evaluated. The relation among cogging torque, the vibration, noise and mechanical stress in these magnet configurations are analyzed. Finally, the generator performance is evaluated and discussed in the different resistance load conditions. Finite element analysis (FEA) is used to evaluate and validate the analysis results. ? 2019 IEEE.",cogging torque; High-Speed generator; Micro-turbine; post-assembly magnetization; rotor vibration,Electric generators; Magnetization; Magnets; Torque; Turbines; Cogging torque; High speed generators; Micro turbine; Post-assembly magnetization; Rotor vibrations; Vibration analysis,"Hsieh, M.-F.; National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan; 電子郵件: mfhsieh@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082385992

Expanding of a source node into a community is one of the most successful methods for local community detection, especially when the global structure of the network is not accessible. In this paper, we propose CLOSE algorithm, Local Community Detection by LOcal Structure Expansion, based on the local expansion technique in the community detection. In CLOSE, we propose a novel connective function to identify a better source node. The node is in the center of a highly connected component of a graph. CLOSE selects a group of nodes instead of a single node to be the seed for the expansion of a local community. In addition, using the neighboring group can identify a suitable community for a hub node. Moreover, the expansion strategy is based on the label propagation technique instead of local community measurements. In experiments, we compare the performance of CLOSE with previous methods both on synthetic networks from the LFR Benchmark and real-world networks. We also examine the merit of the source node selection strategy. Both source node selection and community detection in CLOSE outperform previous algorithms. ? 2019 IEEE.",complex networks; local community detection; neighboring group expansion; source node selection,Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Population dynamics; Community detection; Community discoveries; Connected component; Expansion strategies; Local community; Real-world networks; Source nodes; Synthetic networks; Complex networks,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079074532

Unlike the simulated annealing based algorithm which has to pack each macro to a contour in its representation, a macro can be placed at any empty region according to the corner stitching. Hence, even when a chip contains several preplaced macros which do not abut to boundaries, it can be easily handled by our approach. Moreover, we further apply an efficient and effective simulated evolution algorithm to refine a placement. To avoid standard cells being placed at a small region or being pushed away from related macros in the cell placement stage, our macro placement method also preserves placement areas for standard cells by expanding macros according to the design hierarchy. The experimental results show that our approach obtains better results than CP-tree and a commercial tool in term of wirelength and routability. More importantly, our methodology can complete a large test case in 6 minutes that CP-tree fails to get a result in one day, and their runtime is 659 times longer than ours even when large test cases are ignored. ? 2019 IEEE.",Design hierarchy; Macro placement; Mixed-size; Physical design; Simulated evolution,Computer aided design; Evolutionary algorithms; Forestry; Simulated annealing; Cell placement; Commercial tools; Design hierarchy; Mixed Size; Physical design; Placement methods; Placement problems; Simulated evolutions; Macros,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077793242

To address this inconvenience, this paper proposes a two-electrode ECG measurement method with common electrodes instead of the reference electrode of the right leg. The power supply and the ground of the amplifier supplying the two electrode pairs are not connected and independent. Pasted on the skin with the body as the reference potential, both electrodes detect electrophysiological signals, transmitting the signals through two isolation amplifiers to an instrumentation amplifier filter and generating ECG waveforms. Both previous-stage electrode amplifier circuits of the isolation amplifiers used their respective power supplies; their grounds were unconnected to those of the power supplies. Similarly, the next-stage electrode amplifiers used their respective power supplies, with their grounds unconnected to those of the power supplies. Experiments yielded ECG signal waveforms in Leads I to III, with that of Lead I most resembling the waveforms of conventional reference electrodes.

Furthermore, by applying the proposed calibration and sharing the R-DAC among all channels, the need for gain mismatch calibration between interleaved channels is eliminated.

It was known that the third rail of mass rapid transit (MRT) is often connected to voltage source so as to supply power to the surface-current collector of subway trains. However, considering that the third rail is directly connected to voltage source that needs to be insulated in order to avoid any unexpected consequence, the study of inductive power transfer hence becomes one of alternatives to improve the safety of power delivery. Therefore, by adding the merit of inductive power transfer for rail charging applications with realization assessment, this paper starts with the design of induction coils based on the analysis of mutual coupling characteristics. It is followed by the two-to-one inductive power transfer along with the appropriate completion of resonance circuit in order to ensure a high-efficiency and stable power transmission. To assess the practical value of the proposed method, both hardware realization and software simulation are made and investigated under different test scenarios.

Recently, an enhanced super-resolution based on generative adversarial network (ESRGAN) has achieved excellent performance in terms of both qualitative and quantitative quality of the reconstructed high-resolution image. In this paper, we propose to add one more shortcut between two dense-blocks, as well as add shortcut between two convolution layers inside a dense-block. With this simple strategy of adding more shortcuts in the proposed network, it enables a faster learning process as the gradient information can be back-propagated more easily. Based on the improved ESRGAN, the dual reconstruction is proposed to learn different aspects of the super-resolved image for judiciously enhancing the quality of the reconstructed image. In practice, the super-resolution model is pre-trained solely based on pixel distance, followed by fine-tuning the parameters in the model based on adversarial loss and perceptual loss. Finally, we fuse two different models by weighted-summing their parameters to obtain the final super-resolution model. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method achieves excellent performance in the real-world image super-resolution challenge. We have also verified that the proposed dual reconstruction does further improve the quality of the reconstructed image in terms of both PSNR and SSIM. ? 2019 IEEE.",Deep learning; Dual reconstruction; ESRGAN; Generative adversarial nets; Super resolution,Computer vision; Deep learning; Image enhancement; Optical resolving power; Adversarial networks; ESRGAN; Generative adversarial nets; Gradient informations; High resolution image; Reconstructed image; Super resolution; Super-resolution models; Image reconstruction,,English,Conference Paper,Final,"All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082451563

To extract spatial features from wrist pulse signal, three-dimensional pulse images (3DPI) was proposed by Luo since 2012. A new problem, 3D image denoising, has arisen in research on pulse signal. Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) was used for 3DPIs denoising, but the result was unsatisfactory for lacking prior knowledge of the signal and noise. In order to achieve better denoising performance and three-dimensional visual performance of 3DPIs, we proposed a novel method, Channel-Weighted Robust Principal Component Analysis (CWRPCA), replacing RPCA from the previous 3DPI preprocessing process. In this research, we make a comparison by three indicators: (1) percentage of valid periods, (2) error be-tween channels, and (3) peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The experimental results prove that CWRPCA has the most optimal result, evaluated by the three indicators. In conclusion, CWRPCA has better performance in image denoising for 3DPI and helps subsequent analysis in pulse diagnosis research. ? 2019 IEEE.",Channel-Weighted Robust Principal Component Analysis (CWRPCA); Chinese medicine (CM); three-dimensional pulse images (3DPI); wrist pulse preprocessing,Diagnosis; Image analysis; Image denoising; Noninvasive medical procedures; Signal to noise ratio; 3-D image denoising; Chinese medicines; Noninvasive methods; Peak signal to noise ratio; Pulse image; Robust principal component analysis; Visual performance; wrist pulse preprocessing; Principal component analysis,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078577203

A shallower depth of a microhole array shows better optical properties due to the complete preservation of the GaN/InGaN multiple quantum well (MQW) region. In addition, the use of a thin SiO2 NP/MS passivation layer gives a remarkably reduced reverse-biased leakage current and improved optical performance.

This is conventionally implemented by inserting PMs in rotor flux barriers, and this is often called the PM-assisted SynRM (PMa-SynRM). However, common PMa-SynRMs could be vulnerable to irreversible demagnetization. Therefore, motor performance and PM demagnetization should be simultaneously considered, and this would require the PM to be properly arranged. In this paper, various rotor configurations are carefully studied and compared in order to maximize the motor performance, avoid irreversible demagnetization and achieve higher PM utilization. Moreover, the field weakening capability is investigated and improved by regulating armature excitation. A particular rotor type with flux intensification was found to possess higher PM utilization, lower demagnetization possibility with fairly high performance. Thus, suitable rotor configurations are recommended for certain applications. ? 2019 by the authors.",Flux intensifying; Irreversible demagnetization; PMa-SynRM; SynRM,Demagnetization; Permanent magnets; Field-weakening; Motor performance; Performance analysis; Permanent magnets (pm); PMa-SynRM; Rotor fluxes; Synchronous Reluctance motor; SynRM; Reluctance motors,"Hsieh, M.-F.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: mfhsieh@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072523513

Proteome microarray is an effective tool with high-throughput and rapid platform that systematically identifies the protein targets. In this study, we have used yeast proteome microarrays for systematical identification of the yeast protein targets of Lactoferricin B (Lfcin B) and Histatin-5. A total of 140 and 137 protein targets were identified from the triplicate yeast proteome microarray assays for Lfcin B and Histatin-5, respectively. The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that Lfcin B targeted more enrichment categories than Histatin-5 did in all GO biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. This might be one of the reasons that Lfcin B has a lower minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) than Histatin-5. Moreover, pairwise essential proteins that have lethal effects on yeast were analyzed through synthetic lethality. A total of 11 synthetic lethal pairs were identified within the protein targets of Lfcin B. However, only three synthetic lethal pairs were identified within the protein targets of Histatin-5. The higher number of synthetic lethal pairs identified within the protein targets of Lfcin B might also be the reason for Lfcin B to have lower MIC than Histatin-5. Furthermore, two synthetic lethal pairs were identified between the unique protein targets of Lfcin B and Histatin-5. Both the identified synthetic lethal pairs proteins are part of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) protein complex that regulates gene expression via histone modification. Identification of synthetic lethal pairs between Lfcin B and Histatin-5 and their involvement in the same protein complex indicated synergistic combination between Lfcin B and Histatin-5.

The proposed procedure contains three main methods, which together can efficiently generate highly compacted DPs by using a conventional ATPG tool. First, an all-pairs at-a-time diagnosis pattern generation (AFPAT-DPG) method, which adopts user-defined fault models (UDFMs), is employed to quickly generate DPs for most fault pairs that cannot be distinguished by a given set of, typically fault detection, test patterns (TP). For those fault pairs that cannot be distinguished by AFPAT-DPG, a multipair diagnostic ATPG method (MP-DATPG) is used. MP-DATPG is a complete method in the sense that it can generate diagnosis tests for every distinguishable pair of faults or prove that the pair of faults is indistinguishable. However, due to back-track limits in test generation procedures, diagnosis test generation for some fault pairs may be aborted after the application of the two methods. For such fault pairs, a subcircuit analysis (SCA) method is applied to identify equivalent fault pairs among the aborted fault pairs by trimming the circuit under consideration into one that is much easier to process within the back-track limits of the test generation procedures. Experimental results show that the proposed procedure is the first work that distinguishes 100% of all fault pairs in all ISCAS'89 and IWLS'05 benchmark circuits and over 99.99% for all ITC'99 benchmark circuits using a conventional ATPG tool that generates tests to detect faults. ? 2019 IEEE.",Diagnosis pattern generation (DPG); fault diagnosis; multipairs (MP) diagnosis; stuck-at faults,Automatic test pattern generation; Electric network analysis; Failure analysis; Pattern recognition; Benchmark circuit; Equivalent faults; Pattern Generation; Stuck-at faults; Sub-circuits; Test Compaction; Test generation procedure; Test generations; Fault detection,"Wu, C.-H.; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC)Taiwan; 電子郵件: wuchzn@tsmc.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071380625

The α-Ga2O3 thin films are synthesized from GaOOH with LPD. The α-GaOOH crystal is simply obtained by the dissociation of the Ga(OH)3 precursor solution. GaOOH can be transformed into α-Ga2O3 crystal and form a uniform thin film following post-growth annealing. When the α-Ga2O3 thin film is inserted in between Ni and Si to form a Ni/α-Ga2O3/Si MIS diode, the barrier height of the diode increases by 0.4 eV and the on/off ratio by 100-fold from those of the Ni/Si Schottky diode.

The proposed DCNN model contains two collaborative branches, namely an upper branch to perform oral cancer detection, and a lower branch to perform semantic segmentation and ROI marking. With the upper branch the network model extracts the cancerous regions, and the lower branch makes the cancerous regions more precision. To make the features in the cancerous more regular, the network model extracts the texture images from the input image.

The PMa-SynRM is often designed with multilayer flux barriers to improve saliency and reluctance torque in the rotor. Weaker or less PM (than that for interior PM motors) is embedded into the rotor which could be demagnetized in high-performance operation. PM demagnetization involves temperature, current magnitude, current phase angle, designed PM operating point, or combined effect of the above factors. This work investigates the demagnetization risk for PMs in all the layers of PMa-SynRM rotor considering these factors. In particular, the current phase angle for flux weakening operation is often omitted in demagnetization analysis. First, the motor performance to satisfy the operation condition over a wide speed range is analyzed and the proportion of motor torque components, i.e., reluctance torque and electromagnetic torque, considering temperature is investigated. Then, the flux density distributions on PMs at each position/layer are studied and the PM operating points are obtained based on the variation of excitation current, current phase angle, and temperature in order to evaluate the demagnetization risk. The analysis suggests that the high current phase angle combining the effect of high temperature is the major cause of irreversible demagnetization. Finally, a method incorporating the index 'demagnetization ratio' is proposed to redesign the PMa-SynRM to avoid demagnetization. Experiments are conducted to validate the simulation. ? 1965-2012 IEEE.",Demagnetization ratio; magnet temperature; multilayer magnets; operating point; Permanent magnet-assisted synchronous reluctance motors (PMa-SynRM),Demagnetization; Multilayers; Permanent magnets; Torque; Electromagnetic torques; Flux density distribution; High-performance operation; Magnet temperatures; Multilayer magnets; Operating points; Permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctances; Permanent magnets (pm); Reluctance motors,"Hsieh, M.-F.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: mfhsieh@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067788173

The main challenge in such multicell systems is the co-channel interference, including intra-user interference (IUI) and inter-cell interference (ICI). To deal with both IUI and ICI, most conventional schemes aim to maximize the signal to interference plus noise ratio or throughputs through enormous channel state information (CSI) exchange among base stations. In order to avoid such tremendous overhead, this work proposes a novel framework, containing a distributed subcarrier assignment and a block diagonalization (BD) precoding, to cope with both types of interferences based on limited exchanged information of subcarrier-assignment and local CSIs (channel gains). In the subcarrier-assignment process, each sector’s base station independently assigns a subset of the served UEs to be served over the subcarrier. The channel gains of a particular subcarrier hold a semi-orthogonal property for that subset. Then, on the basis of limited exchanges of information, a BD-type precoding is presented to completely eliminate all IUI and suppress the major part of the leakage interference to the adjacent sectors by exploiting principal component analysis. The simulation results indicate that the proposed framework can provide more QoS-satisfied UEs than that obtained in a previous work. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Cellular network; Interference management; MU-MIMO; Precoding; Principal component analysis; Resource allocation,Base stations; Channel state information; MIMO systems; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Signal interference; Signal to noise ratio; Cellular network; Intercell interference; Interference management; MU-MIMO; Multi user multiple input multiple outputs; Precoding; Resource allocation schemes; Signal to interference plus noise ratio; Principal component analysis,"Chih, T.-H.; Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: daz@pcnw3.ee.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066123822

For a retail store, the common indicator of profit is its popularity which can be measured by the number of people who had ever consumed there. If one can know the potential popularity of locations along the time or within a certain time period (e.g., Christmas holiday or some memorial days) in advance, it would facilitate the determination of locations that are more profitable for the geographical placement of new retail stores. In this paper, given a targeted retail chain as well as some candidate locations, we propose to predict the popularity values of these locations over time to support their decisions on placing new stores.

To handle this problem, the three-stage mixed-size placement methodology is considered as the most suitable approach for a commercial design flow, where the placement prototyping is the most important stage. Since standard cells and macros have to be considered simultaneously in this stage, it is more complicated than the other two stages. To reduce complexity and improve design quality, this paper applies the multilevel framework with a design hierarchy-guided clustering scheme for getting a better coarsening result in order to improve outcome in the following stages. We propose an efficient and effective clustering scheme to group standard cells and macros based on the tree built from their design hierarchies. More importantly, our clustering algorithm considers indirect connectivity between macros which is ignored by previous works. Moreover, we propose a new overlapping bounding box constraint to avoid clustering improper macros which have connections to fixed pins. The experimental results show that wirelength and routability are improved by our methodology. ? 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Clustering; Design hierarchy; Indirect connectivity; Macro placement,Coarsening; Computer aided design; Clustering; Clustering scheme; Commercial design; Design hierarchy; Design Quality; Indirect connectivity; Mixed-size placement; Standard cell; Clustering algorithms,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067797726

Measuring the influence spread of set of seed nodes and gradually selecting the node with largest marginal increase is one of the main approaches of existing algorithms. In this paper, we try to solve this problem from a different strategy-in an improvement perspective. A more complex condition is depicted as both positive and negative opinions are propagating in the social network. The objective function considers the maximization of the positive influence and minimizes the negative opinion spreading simultaneously. We propose IDR (Influence Distribution Redirection) algorithm to define initial seed nodes of influence diffusion based on redirecting the influence distribution of nodes to maximize the objective function. The influence distribution of nodes shows the potential influence trend of nodes during the influence diffusion process. The key strategy is reducing the positive influence nearby the steady nodes and increasing in the vacillate region. From the experimental results, IDR outperforms the compared method on the objective function. In addition, IDR also improves the performance of increasing the number of positive active nodes and decreasing the number of negative activated nodes respectively. ? 2019 IEEE.",Influence Maximization; Positive and Negative Opinions; Social Network Analysis,Backpropagation; Information management; Active node; Complex condition; Diffusion process; Influence maximizations; Linear threshold models; Objective functions; Positive and Negative Opinions; Word of mouth; Social networking (online),,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070944282

The proposed approach combines the merits of both the orthogonal functions approach and evolutionary optimization. By solving a Sylvester equation, the proposed optimal design method can not only be used to design the reduced-order observer of a non-observable-form-based dynamical system, but also can avoid the shortcomings of approaches already existing in relevant literatures. Two examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed new optimization method on the performance of state estimations. From the demonstrative examples, it can be seen that the estimated state errors asymptotically converge quickly to zero.

The overlapped states indicated that Ge4+ and Co2+ could be the sensitizers to enhance the emission intensity. Then the phosphor was synthesized by conventional solid-state reaction. The effects of calcination temperature and Mn4+ doping concentration were investigated to determine the optimal preparation conditions. Through the analysis of XRD and PL, it can be found that the crystallinity plays an important role in the luminescent intensity. In addition, the emission intensity increases 55% and 316% after doping of Ge4+ and Co2+, respectively.

However, the renewable energies sources (RES) are becoming increasingly popular recently. Their uncertainty and uncontrollability may complex the mentioned problem. In view of this, this paper proposes a two-stage generator unit scheduling approach for day-ahead electricity market operation to ensure compliance with grid codes while reducing operating costs. In the first stage, the fast Fourier transformation (FFT)-based analysis method is proposed to precisely estimate the requirement of various levels frequency-regulation reserve capacity (FRRC), which can not only avoid the extra cost caused by excessive reserve capacity, but also ensure the fluctuation resulted by the high RES penetration can be dealt with. Besides, the second stage is a joint optimization strategy which integrates economic dispatch (ED) and FRRC optimal allocation considering the grid security restrictions and the characteristics of the generator units, such as operational cost and ramping rate.

In general, a two-stage configuration is used to convert the generating AC power from the tidal current generator to DC power by a rectifier and transfer the DC power into AC power by an inverter to provide a stable voltage source. It is noticed that a small size capacitor of the rectifier is possible and the discontinuous current can be improved. However, a small size capacitor implies the higher voltage ripple and results in a lots of low-order voltage harmonics of the inverter with traditional SPWM control. Therefore, a modified modulation control strategy is developed in this paper. The proposed inverter has lower total harmonic distortion (THD)of the output voltage with high input voltage ripple.

For a traditional system architecture on multi-target vital-signs monitoring, complicated systems are required such as phased array radar or continuous wave (CW) radar with beamforming technology. In contrast, this architecture has the advantage of enhanced resolution capability, relatively simple circuit, and low cost. By using advanced signal processing such as adaptive boundary, we can detect multi-target vital signs even though the difference of the distances to the two targets is less than the range resolution of FMCW radar. In terms of demodulation, heart rate (HR) is susceptible to the harmonic of respiratory rate (RR) using complex signal demodulation (CSD). Therefore, this paper uses an ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) algorithm to extract the intrinsic mode functions of RR and HR. Experiments show that, we can improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and accuracy significantly using this algorithm.

Co-doping with KI and water showed a pronounced improvement in crystallinity and the elimination of carrier traps, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.9%, which was approximately 60% higher than the pristine reference cell.

The proposed algorithm consists of an initial assignment phase and a compensation phase. In the first phase, each subcarrier is assigned to mobile users with higher channel gains and lower mutual co-channel interferences. The second phase further compensates mobile users who do not get adequate resources to meet the requirement of quality of service in the first phase.

The MAPbI3 film is prepared on top of the PEDOT:PSS by a two-step process, showing a bipolar resistive switching character. Because PEDOT:PSS is widely used as a hole transporting layer for a planar heterojunction perovskite solar cell, the demonstrated memory property of PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3 combination opens up the application potential for multifunctional optoelectronic memory. The device is improved by introducing potassium iodide (KI) as an additive to ameliorate the quality of MAPbI3 material and PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3 interface. As compared with the pristine MAPbI3, the KI-doped perovskite device exhibits a resistive switching ON/OFF ratio of 103, better endurance and more stable retention. The KI additive is helpful for forming uniform crystalline grain, high-compact structure and passivation of defect states for MAPbI3 film and interface, which are the main reasons to the improved memory properties.

However, it was believed that the atomically thin layered materials are not able to show memristive effect in vertically stacked structure, until the recent discovery of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) atomristors, overcoming the scaling limit to sub-nanometer. Herein, the nonvolatile resistance switching (NVRS) phenomenon in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), a typical 2D insulator, is reported. The h-BN atomristors are studied using different electrodes and structures, featuring forming-free switching in both unipolar and bipolar operations, with large on/off ratio (up to 10 7 ). Moreover, fast switching speed (&lt;15 ns) is demonstrated via pulse operation. Compared with monolayer TMDs, the one-atom-thin h-BN sheet reduces the vertical scaling to ?0.33 nm, representing a record thickness for memory materials. Simulation results based on ab-initio method reveal that substitution of metal ions into h-BN vacancies during electrical switching is a likely mechanism. The existence of NVRS in monolayer h-BN indicates fruitful interactions between defects, metal ions and interfaces, and can advance emerging applications on ultrathin flexible memory, printed electronics, neuromorphic computing, and radio frequency switches. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Recently, the thermoelectric behavior of ZnO has drawn much attention because it is expected to enrich the multifunctional application of ZnO. However, the high thermal conductivity nature of ZnO (?50 W/(m·K)) is a challenge to further increase its thermoelectrtic figure of merit (ZT). In this paper, a way to increase the ZT of ZnO thin films by insertion of silicon-rich oxide (SRO) interlayers is reported. All of the constituents are earth-abundant and environmental friendly. The effects of the number of SRO layers, thickness, grain size, heat treatment, and crystallinity of ZnO of the superlattices on the thermoelectric behaviors of ZnO were investigated. The thermoelectric ZT was determined by the transient Harman method by measuring the Seebeck voltage. The thermal conductivity of the ZnO/SRO superlattices that is crucial to elucidate the ZT behaviors is calculated using molecular dynamic simulation, in which the Zn-O and Zn-Zn interactions were described by the Born-Mayer potential and the short-range non-Coulombic O-O interaction was described by the Morse potential. For a given total ZnO/SRO thickness, the grain size of the ZnO decreases monotonically with the increasing number of SRO layers, thus leading to a decrease of the thermal conductivity and an increase of the ZT of the superlattices. As the best result, the annealed 45 nm thick ZnO thin film with three SRO interlayers presents a high ZT of ?0.16 at room temperature. A comprehensive study on the ZnO/SRO superlattice-based thermoelectrtic devices was carried out by the experiment and theoretical simulation. The results imply potential thermoelectric application of the ZnO/SRO superlattices.

Many researches have been devoted to developing the corresponding hardware accelerators. To reduce the circuit complexity while maintaining sufficient throughput, on-chip memories are commonly partitioned into several banks for parallel data access. However, since the coefficients of feature extraction are irregular, memory access conflict would frequently occur without proper scheduling. The proposed scheme explicitly schedules the access sequence as a post-processing for managing the coefficient memory. By formulating the desired sequence as a graph model, the classical graph coloring theory can then be adopted to solve the scheduling problem. In addition, the proposed graph model also considers the resource constraint on intermediate storage.

The proposed circuit exploits the time-division driving method to implement the in-cell touch panels with a high report rate and prevent the distortion of touch signals. The proposed structure employs a highly reliable precharging circuit to ameliorate the degradation of the driving TFT during the long-term touch-sensing stages. The output TFTs in the precharging structure are activated only once at the end of the touch-sensing stage in a frame, effectively extending the lifetime of the circuit. The experimental and simulated results illustrate that the proposed gate driver circuit generates uniform output waveforms regardless of whether the circuit operates in forward and backward transmission or stops in any row. To verify the high reliability of the proposed gate driver circuit, long-term stress tests at 85 °C are conducted.

In AI, analytics algorithms are typically used to analyze speech, audio, image video data, etc. In current cross-level system design methodology different algorithmic realizations are analyzed in the form of dataflow graphs (DFG) to further increase efficiency and flexibility in constituting 'analytics architecture'. Having information on both algorithmic behavior and architectural information including software and hardware, the DFG so introduced provides a mathematical representation which, as opposed to traditional linear difference equations, better models the underlying computational platform for systematic analysis thus providing flexible and efficient management of the computational and storage resources. In our analytics architecture work, parallel and reconfigurable computing are formulated via DFG which are analogous to the analysis and synthesis equations of the well-known Fourier transform pair. In parallel computing, a connected component is eigen-decomposed to unconnected components for concurrent processing. For computation resource saving, commonalities in DFGs are analyzed for reuse when synthesizing or reconfiguring the edge platform. In this paper, we specifically introduce lightweight edge upon which algorithmic convolution for Convolution Neural Network are eigen-transformed to matrix operations with higher symmetry which facilitates fewer operations, lower data transfer rate and storage anticipating lower power when synthesizing or reconfiguring the eigenvectors. ? 2019 IEEE.",analytics architecture; breadth-first search; convolution neural network; dataflow graph; principal component analysis,Artificial intelligence; Convolution; Data flow analysis; Data flow graphs; Data transfer; Data transfer rates; Difference equations; Digital storage; Network architecture; Principal component analysis; Reconfigurable architectures; Algorithmic realization; Breadth-first search; Computational platforms; Convolution neural network; Linear difference equations; Mathematical representations; Reconfigurable computing; Reconfigurable processing; Information management,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070436883

Such people experience the greatest degree of difficulty during phone conversations in noisy environments. Purpose: This study compared the benefits of a linear scheme with a compression amplification scheme fitted with a prescription for sloping-type hearing loss implemented in a Bluetooth ALD in quiet and noisy environments. Research Design: Word recognition scores (WRSs) for the Mandarin monosyllable recognition test (MMRT) and participants' satisfaction ratings were measured to serve as objective and subjective results, respectively. Study Sample: Twelve native Mandarin speakers aged 27-68 yr with mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss participated in this study. Intervention: A compression amplification scheme with a prescription in maximizing speech intelligibility for sloping-type hearing loss was implemented in a Bluetooth ALD. Data Collection and Analysis: The MMRT WRSs of participants wearing the Bluetooth ALD were collected. Each test was conducted in a soundproof booth under quiet and 65-dBA speech noise environments. Each participant completed a satisfaction questionnaire administered by an audiologist. The collected WRSs were examined using analyses of variance and the satisfaction ratings were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Results: The mean MMRT WRSs of the compression amplification scheme were significantly higher than those of the linear scheme (57% and 53% higher in quiet and noisy environments, respectively). The mean satisfaction ratings of both schemes were between neutral and satisfied in the quiet environment, whereas in the noisy environment, the participants were more satisfied with the compression scheme than the linear scheme.

By observing that the original nonuniformly illuminated image has good performance in the bright area and the Retinex improved image has outstanding performance in the dark area, algorithms aiming to integrate the merits from both images were proposed. In this paper, we proposed an algorithm which performs the wavelet transform (WT) before segmentation and mixing. The wavelet transform decomposes an image into the coarse component and the detail components. The segmentation is performed on the course component and the result is used to fuse the course and detail components from both sources. The proposed algorithm is first subjectively assessed by using the dynamic range independent image quality assessment metric (DRIM) and compared with three existing algorithms. Experimental results show that the improved images using our proposed algorithm reveal significant amplification of contrast in the dark areas and mild loss and reversal of contrast in other areas.

To support group communications, each group members have to receive data sent from the group application server (GAS) maintained in ProSe. This paper discusses the use of vehicle-mounted mobile base station to provide group communications over a two-tier heterogeneous architecture with the aid of GAS and ProSe links. In this method, each vehicle-mounted mobile base station (BS) works in a cell breathing manner to expand or shrink the cell coverage periodically. This way can ensure GAS having the up-to-date proximity knowledge of all users while the part of high-cost group data traffic due to the users located far from the BS can be offloaded to low-cost ProSe links instead. We formulate the minimum cost problem of the ProSe-based File Distribution (PFD) in such architecture. We prove the minimum PFD problem is NP-complete and then proposes three sources selection algorithms for PFD, namely Greedy algorithm, Defer algorithm, and Recursive algorithm.

The proposed pixel circuit uses overlapping compensation times to extend the period of precise sensing of VTH variations of LTPS TFTs. Moreover, the proposed circuit prevents a current from flowing into an OLED when the OLED is not operated in the emission stage to avoid image flicker.

The main idea is to record (store) all required compressed test data in a novel scan chain structure, and extract and decompress them during testing. This requires a very high compression ratio to obtain a low test data volume, that is, smaller than the number of scan cells in the circuit under test. To achieve such a high compression ratio, we propose a novel compression method that combines broadcast scan as well as a tailored single-input compression architecture. We also utilize the concept of scan chain partitioning and clock gating to reduce the test time and test power. An on-chip test controller is employed to automatically generate all required control signals for the whole test procedure. This significantly reduces the requirements on external automatic test equipment. Experimental results show that our method is well suitable for multicore designs. For example, experiments on the 8-core open-source OpenSPARC T2 processor with 5.7M gates show that all required test data for 100% testable stuck-at fault coverage can be stored in just 59.4% of the scan cells of the processor.

To improve the properties of the MgNiO films, the films were annealed at various temperatures. The grain size of 18.5 nm for the as-deposited MgNiO films was improved to 23.4 nm and 24.8 nm for the MgNiO films annealed at 500 °C and 600 °C for 60 min, respectively. For the film-structured MSM-UVPDs with 500 °C-annealed MgNiO films operated at a bias voltage of 5 V, the photoresponsivity, average noise current, noise equivalent power, and specific detectivity were 1.78 × 10?2 A/W, 3.74 × 10?12 A, 2.10 × 10?10 W, and 1.50 × 109 cmHz0.5W?1, respectively. Aluminum (Al) nanospheres were stacked on the film-structured MgNiO MSM-UVPDs. The performance of the resulting Al-nanosphere-stacked MgNiO MSM-UVPDs was improved by increasing the density of the Al nanospheres. With an Al nanosphere density of approximately 2.0 × 107/mm2, when the Al-nanosphere-stacked MgNiO MSM-UVPDs operated at a bias voltage of 5 V, the photoresponsivity, average noise current, noise equivalent power, and specific detectivity were 2.00 × 10?1 A/W, 7.71 × 10?12 A, 3.88 × 10?11 W, and 8.16 × 109 cmHz0.5W?1, respectively. Despite the noise induced by the Al nanospheres, the performance of the Al-nanosphere-stacked MgNiO MSM-UVPDs was better than that of the film-structured MgNiO MSM-UVPDs.

In this work, we propose a unique RRAM cell with a double switching layer, in which a 2D material is embedded as a separation layer. Within a proper voltage range of stress, the mobile oxygen ions are blocked by the single atomic layer, and hence the subsequent relaxation of oxygen ions leads to a volatile switching characteristic.

Self-similarity, a critical prior knowledge yielding great success in regularizing various imaging inverse problems, has been widely observed in natural images; its formalization is not, however, straightforward. Very recently, we mathematically described the self-similarity pattern as a weighted graph, which can then be transformed into an explicit convex regularizer, that is adopted in our pansharpening criterion design. Most importantly, such convexity allows the adoption of convex optimization theory in solving self-similarity regularized inverse problems with convergence guarantee. One step of our pansharpening algorithm is exactly the proximal operator induced by our new self-similarity regularizer, which is solved by another customized algorithm that is interesting in its own right as could be used as a denoiser. Experiments show promising performance of the proposed method. ? 2019 IEEE.",Convex optimization; Denoiser; Panchromatic sharpening; Proximal operator; Self-similarity regularization,Convex optimization; Differential equations; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Convex optimization theory; Multispectral images; Multispectral satellite imagery; Pan-sharpening; Panchromatic images; Prior knowledge; Satellite imaging; Self-similarities; Inverse problems,"Lin, C.-H.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: chiahsiang.steven.lin@gmail.com",English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102327294

The visual-based approach is the simplest and most effective enabling technology to reach the goal. In performing such an overtaking maneuver, this vision-based driving assistant system must be able to precisely recognize the lane marks first. The traditional approach needs a classifier with hand-crafted features and an adjusted threshold to achieve a robust lane detection in various environment conditions. In this paper, we adopt the deep learning approach to achieve the robust lane detection. The proposed lane detection network inspired by LaneNet model, which uses semantic segmentation concepts utilizes multiple level features of the encoder and designs enhanced binary segmentation and reduced pixel embedding branches. By reduction of computation in decoders, the proposed network effectively utilizes multilevel features to precisely predict the high quality lane maps.

However, the Internet has been subject to a variety of attacks. Several notable attack events have been reported, such as those involving the use of flooding flows on widely used message boards, installation of malware in an automated teller machine to steal more than 80 million, and use of WannaCry to encrypt users’ files and request for ransoms. The majority of the attacks cannot be defended using single methods. Network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) and host-based IDSs (HIDSs) can determine whether a system has been attacked. A NIDS alone cannot detect web-based attacks or system vulnerabilities. Thus, this paper proposes a risk assessment system (RAS) that integrates a NIDS and HIDS to detect suspicious behaviors and assess the risk value of Internet protocols (IPs). The RAS focuses on the analysis of attack or suspicious behaviors using the NIDS and HIDS. Furthermore, the system quantizes the influence of attackers in suspicious events by using PageRank. Finally, the RAS derives the risk value of every IP to warn users of an attack and protect hosts or devices from the attacks. ? 2019 Taiwan Academic Network Management Committee.

The proposed prototype is designed with mechanical and electronic circuit hardware as well as the control and data acquisition software to have fourteen degrees of movement freedom against the sophisticated geometry of the wrist radial artery for accurate pulse-taking. Three robot fingers with nine degrees of movement freedom and a wrist fixer with two degrees of rotation freedom and one degree of manual movement freedom are designed to mimic the fine pulse-taking skill of a Chinese medicine physician. The customer-designed array sensors with 5 × 5-1 sensing elements in an array are attached on the robot fingertips to get 3DPI with spatial information for direct translation of pulse feeling patterns in Chinese medicine texts, in addition to being compatible with 1D pulse wave analysis. To check reliability of the prototype, adopted is SphygmoCor with pulse data correlation. Consequently, the prototype passes safety tests and has high correlation of pulse data (waveform and peripheral augmented index) with those obtained by SphygmoCor. The automatic multi-depth pulse-taking with robot fingers attached array sensors on their tips can get acceptably repeatable pulse data with coefficient of variation less than 10%. By simultaneous pulse-taking at Cun-Guan-Chi positions, 3DPIs demonstrate great different stereoscopic waveshapes against almost unchanged single temporal pulse waveshape.

To improve safety of the system, a self-collision avoidance system was incorporated so that the various parts of the robot do not collide with each other while imitating human motions. The imitated motion was recorded and stored in a motion dataset as a reference motion. To address different situations and objects, the reference motion was adjusted using the motion augmented system in which both the adjusted trajectory and its corresponding motor angles were generated using the integrated adaptive constricted particle swarm optimization algorithm. So that, the adjusted motion can adapt to the real situation while maintaining similarity with the reference motion.

The dual-band bandpass filter is implemented using a stepped-impedance ring loaded resonator (SIRLR). The properties of the SIRLR are analyzed in detail based on the even- and odd-mode equivalent circuits. Resonant modes, excited by SIRLR, can be controlled and used to form a narrow passband at 2.4 GHz with bandwidth ratio of 8% and a wide passband from 3 to 5 GHz, with insertion losses less than 1.5 dB for both two passbands. Three transmission zeros are created near the passband edge to improve the passband selectivity and achieve a sharp cutoff skirt (over 60 dB/GHz). In addition, for wide stopband consideration, rectangular stub loaded resonators (RSLRs) are tapped on the input and output ports of above dual-band filter without destroying the dual-band performances. Thus, the proposed dual-band filter with a wide stopband region from 5 to 20 GHz with a rejection level of 25 dB is also achieved.

We approach this task by two phases, i.e., the routing-path developing and multi-flow scheduling phases, respectively. In the first phase, we develop the routing path by taking the multiple high-rate hops into consideration. With the aid of full-duplex relay, using multiple high-rate hops can possibly be more efficient than the low-rate direct transmission. In the second phase, overlapping the scheduling round (SR) can more effectively utilize the full-duplex relay. Conventionally, the SR are arranged in the bumper-to-bumper fashion. Whereas, overlapping the SR can fully utilize the unoccupied time slots.

In fact, with the CCSP techniques, we transform the problem of wildcard SE searching into a problem of subsequence searching, which is solved fast in most databases and thus fits well with cloud services in general. Although in our security analysis, CCSP removes the possibility of obtaining theoretical indistinguishability between indexed items, we show that FETCH does provide adequate confidentiality protection and fares much better than other existing wildcard SE schemes in terms of query performance, storage overhead, and deployment complexity.

The main challenge in such multicell systems is the co-channel interference, including intra-user interference (IUI) and inter-cell interference (ICI). To deal with both IUI and ICI, most conventional schemes aim to maximize the signal to interference plus noise ratio or throughputs through enormous channel state information (CSI) exchange among base stations. In order to avoid such tremendous overhead, this work proposes a novel framework, containing a distributed subcarrier assignment and a block diagonalization (BD) precoding, to cope with both types of interferences based on limited exchanged information of subcarrier-assignment and local CSIs (channel gains). In the subcarrier-assignment process, each sector’s base station independently assigns a subset of the served UEs to be served over the subcarrier. The channel gains of a particular subcarrier hold a semi-orthogonal property for that subset. Then, on the basis of limited exchanges of information, a BD-type precoding is presented to completely eliminate all IUI and suppress the major part of the leakage interference to the adjacent sectors by exploiting principal component analysis. The simulation results indicate that the proposed framework can provide more QoS-satisfied UEs than that obtained in a previous work. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Cellular network; Interference management; MU-MIMO; Precoding; Principal component analysis; Resource allocation,Base stations; Channel state information; MIMO systems; Quality of service; Resource allocation; Signal interference; Signal to noise ratio; Cellular network; Intercell interference; Interference management; MU-MIMO; Multi user multiple input multiple outputs; Precoding; Resource allocation schemes; Signal to interference plus noise ratio; Principal component analysis,"Chih, T.-H.; Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: daz@pcnw3.ee.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065966568

Furthermore, for the cascaded pi-phase-shifted long-period waveguide gratings (LPWG), the two resonance wavelengths are symmetrically shifted away from the center wavelength in response to an increase in the number of LPWG sections incorporated. ? 2019 SPIE.",Long-period waveguide grating (LPWG); Optical waveguides; Phase shift grating; Proton exchange; Waveguide filters,Lithium; Niobium compounds; Optical waveguides; Optoelectronic devices; Experimental approaches; Lithium Niobate Waveguide; Logical sequences; Long-period waveguide gratings; Phase shift grating; Proton exchange; Resonance wavelengths; Waveguide gratings; Waveguide filters,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065774421

Previous approaches have usually generated the summary by extracting the top K salient sentences on graph-based ranking algorithms, but sentence feature representation only captures the surface relationship between the objects, hence the results may not accurately reflect the user’s intentions. Therefore, we propose a method to address this challenge, and: (1) obtain deeper semantic concepts among candidate sentences using meaningful sentence vectors combining word vectors and TF-IDF; (2) rank the sentences considering both relationships between sentences and the user’s intention for each sentence to identify significant sentences, and apply these to a heterogeneous graph; (3) generate the result sentence by sentence to ensure summary semantics are properly related to the original document. We verified the proposed approach experimentally using English summarization benchmark datasets DUC2001 and DUC2002; the large Chinese summarization data set, LCSTS.

The designed filter exhibits a broader bandwidth and a sharper cut-off frequency than the conventional filter composed of the ladder and double-mode SAW (DMS) types. The SAW filters have been widely applied to the antenna duplexer given the progress in mobile communication technology. Furthermore, the SAW filters can be constructed into a wireless sensor system in combination with a SAW sensor. We demonstrate how simulations of ladder-type SAW filters based on the 48°YX-LiTaO 3 are used to achieve a convenient design of the SAW band-pass filter for a high-power and wireless sensor system. These filters demonstrate the lowest insertion loss, the largest bandwidth, the optimal power durability, and a third-order intercept point compared with the interdigital transducer (IDT) and DMS. A simulation of a SAW resonator using the advanced design system (ADS) is performed with the lumped elements. The first passband that is applied to the Tx duplexer is in the range of 823–855 MHz, and the second passband applied to the Rx duplexer is from 867 to 898 MHz. The frequency characteristics of the ladder-type duplexer possess minimum insertion losses of 1.14 dB in the first passband and 0.54 dB in the second passband, which are similar to those of the DMS duplexer. The isolation performance between Tx and Rx is 42.22 dB at 823–898 MHz, which is less than that of the DMS duplexer. The design of the appropriate SAW band pass filter will be simplified through a precise simulation. Furthermore, the dual-band structure with a ladder-type SAW can be expected to endure higher power and have a better isolation performance than conventional DMS structures. ?

However, the random drift of MEMS-based gyroscopes limits their applications. Hence, studies pay attention to develop various models to model and compensate the random drift for improving the performance of the MEMS-based gyroscopes. This paper presents a self-constructing Wiener-type recurrent neural network (SCWRNN) with its false nearest-neighbors-based self-constructing strategy and recursive recurrent learning algorithm to model the random drift of the MEMS-based gyroscopes and then compensate them from the calibrated gyroscope measurement. Subsequently, the proposed random drift modeling and compensation algorithm is integrated into the handwriting trajectory reconstruction algorithm of the inertial-sensing-based HCI device, called IMUPEN, for accurately obtaining the reconstructed handwriting trajectory. Users can hold the IMUPEN, which is composed of an accelerometer, two gyroscopes, a microcontroller, and an RF wireless transmission module, to write numerals at normal speed. The accelerations and angular velocities measured by the accelerometer and gyroscopes are transmitted to a personal computer through the RF module for further reconstructing the handwriting trajectory via the handwriting trajectory reconstruction algorithm. In addition, we have developed the SCWRNN-based random drift modeling and compensation algorithm to eliminate the cumulative errors caused by the random drift of the MEMS-based gyroscopes for further increasing the accuracy of handwriting trajectory reconstruction. Our experimental results have successfully validated the effectiveness of the proposed random drift modeling and compensation algorithm and its application in handwriting trajectory reconstruction. ? 2019 IEEE.",handwriting trajectory reconstruction; MEMS-based gyroscope; Random drift modeling; recurrent neural network,Accelerometers; Human computer interaction; MEMS; Microelectromechanical devices; Personal computers; Random errors; Recurrent neural networks; Trajectories; Compensation algorithm; Cumulative errors; False nearest neighbor; Human computer interaction (HCI); MEMS based gyroscopes; Micro electromechanical system (MEMS); Random drift modeling; Trajectory reconstruction; Gyroscopes,"Hsu, Y.-L.; Department of Automatic Control Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: hsuyl@fcu.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061836969

Recently, investigating HU under the non-negligible endmember variability (EV) and outlier effects (OE) has drawn extensive attention. Some state-of-the-art works either consider EV or consider OE, but none of them considers both EV and OE simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel HU algorithm, referred to as the variability/outlier-insensitive multi-convex unmixing (VOIMU) algorithm, which is robust against both EV and OE. Considering two suitable regularizers, a nonconvex minimization problem is formulated for which the perturbed linear mixing model proposed by Thouvenin et al., is used for modeling EV, while OE is implicitly handled by applying a p quasi-norm to the data fitting with 0 < p < 1. Then, we reformulate it into a multi-convex problem which is then solved by the block coordinate descent method, with convergence guarantee by casting it into the block successive upper bound minimization framework. The proposed VOIMU algorithm can yield a stationary-point solution with convergence guarantee, together with some intriguing information of potential outlier pixels though outliers are neither physically modeled in the above problem nor detected in the algorithm operation. Finally, we provide some simulation results and experimental results using real data to demonstrate the efficacy and practical applicability of the proposed VOIMU algorithm. ? 2018 IEEE.",alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM); block coordinate descent (BCD) method; block successive upper bound minimization (BSUM); endmember variability; Hyperspectral imaging; outlier effects,Spectroscopy; Statistics; Alternating direction method of multipliers; Block coordinate descents; Endmember variabilities; Outlier effect; Upper Bound; Hyperspectral imaging,"Chi, C.-Y.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: cychi@ee.nthu.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061785051

In the presence of sight obstructions, BTrack is evaluated using a real-world test bed built in a library with tall bookshelves. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated in terms of the mean distance error and the LA prediction accuracy considering the direct line-of-sight. Compared with the existing methods, BTrack reduces the average localization error by 25% and improves the average prediction accuracy by more than 16% given a random mobility pattern. ? 2013 IEEE.",beacons; Bluetooth; machine learning; Markov chain; particle filter; People tracking; position accuracy; resampling,Bluetooth; Indoor positioning systems; Learning systems; Location; beacons; Particle filter; People tracking; Position accuracy; Resampling; Markov processes,"Sou, S.-I.; Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: sisou@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060728214

Each mobile individual can belong to an online social network. Unfortunately, the underlying online social relationships are hidden and only available to service providers. Acquiring the social network of mobile users would enrich lots of mobile applications, such as friend recommendation and energy-saving mobile database management. In this work, we propose to infer online social ties using purely offline geographical activities of users, such as check-in records and spatial meeting events. To tackle the problem, we devise a novel inference framework, O2O-Inf, which consists of two components, Feature Modeling and Link Inference. Feature modeling is to characterize both direct and indirect geographical interactions between nodes from co-location and graph features. Link inference aims to infer the social ties based on a small set of observed social links, and the idea is that pairs of nodes sharing similar geographical behaviors have the same tendency of linkage (i.e., either being friends or non-friends). Experiments conducted on a Gowalla location-based social network and a Meetup event-based social network exhibit a satisfying performance in comparison to state-of-the-art prediction methods under the settings of offline-to-online network inference and geo-link prediction. ? 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Link prediction; Location-based services; Network inference; Offline geographical activities; Online social ties,Energy conservation; Forecasting; Location; Location based services; Telecommunication services; Friend recommendations; Link prediction; Location-based social networks; Mobile database management; Network inference; Offline; On-line social networks; Social ties; Social networking (online),,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060065282

SLM is composed of many pixels arranged in an array which can be controlled by electrically triggered pulses to generate different coding patterns. By using SLMs we can modulate users’ data signal with different CGH pattern array to prevent from deciphering of eavesdropper. According to the transmitted holographic information from transmitter encoder to receiver decoder, symmetrical balanced decoders can be configured (and reconfigured) to recover coded data bit of each network user by correlating the received combined hologram patterns with the desired CGH pattern over photo-detector. In the proposed system, each user encodes the transmitted data bit with signature maximal-length sequence (M-sequence) code which are further mapped onto a CGH coding pattern. Due to the pseudo-orthogonal and reconfigurable characteristics of M-sequence codes, eavesdropper will suffer more difficulty in deciphering received data signal.

Once macros are placed with regularity, powerplanning will become easier and better routability can be obtained. Our methodology consists of two stages. First, placement prototyping stage distributes cells and macros over a placement region while keeping those macros and cells with a strong connection and in similar hierarchies tied together. This is facilitated by clustering macros and cells properly in advance. In the second stage, a deterministic macro legalization algorithm is proposed to arrange macros without deteriorating the result obtained in the previous stage. Although several macro legalization algorithms have been proposed in recent years, most of these works adopt the simulated annealing algorithm which usually takes longer runtime. Moreover, they either cannot handle preplaced macros or require preplaced macros to be abutted to chip boundaries.

Due to the twisted routes of the sub-coils in the proposed inductor, the interference caused by a nearby electromagnetic noise source can be compensated and reduced. By using a 0.18-μm standard CMOS process, the proposed inductor and a conventional single-turn spiral inductor in a similar size are integrated into two respective VCO testchips. The injection pulling behaviors of these two oscillators are studied and compared. The experimental results show that the VCO integrated with the proposed honeycomb-shaped planar inductor can significantly mitigate the injection pulling phenomenon as compared with the VCO integrated with a conventional single-turn inductor in a similar size. In this brief, the enhancement of mitigation over 15 dB can be achieved. ? 2004-2012 IEEE.",CMOS; honeycomb-shaped planar inductor; Injection pulling; VCO; voltage-controlled oscillator,Circuit oscillations; CMOS integrated circuits; Honeycomb structures; Oscillistors; Variable frequency oscillators; Electromagnetic noise; Injection pulling; Planar inductor; Spiral inductor; Standard CMOS process; Two oscillators; Electric inductors,"Huang, T.-H.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: thhuang@ee.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045301836
