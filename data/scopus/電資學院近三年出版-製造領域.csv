However, they have not been extensively exploited for home use. One critical reason for this is that building the environmental model relies highly on manual operations. In this letter, image sensors are adopted to automatically build an environmental model and reduce the labor burden of exploiting fire simulation tools for a fire safety check. To increase the accuracy of an environmental model, our automation extracts the essential features affecting fires from images using recognition models and the proposed approaches. Our automation converts the environmental data into an FDS6 syntax. The experimental results reveal the feasibility of our automation. Compared to a manual operation, our approach not only reduces the labor burden but also the inconsistent environmental model owing to a manual operation as well. ? 2017 IEEE.",automation system; digital twin; environmental inspection; fire simulator; image processing; Sensor applications,Automation; Fires; Automation systems; Environmental inspection; Environmental model; Fire safety; Fire simulators; Images processing; Labor burden; Manual operations; Safety check; Size measurements; Image processing,"Tsai, Y.-Y.; Institute of Manufacturing Information and Systems, Taiwan; 電子郵件: p96074163@gs.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118667300

Semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities (wafer fabs) belong to this class of manufacturing systems. A profit-based objective function is considered. Clearing functions are used in the planning formulation to correctly represent the lead time behavior in the case of a congested system. Order acceptance decisions are made with respect to flexible due dates, i.e., it is possible to reject certain orders if there is not enough capacity. Such acceptance decisions are important, for instance, in short-term demand supply matching algorithms that are crucial for demand fulfillment and available to promise decisions in semiconductor manufacturing. The resulting planning problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program. We first show that the resulting planning problem is NP-hard. Hence, computationally tractable approaches must be designed. Therefore, variable neighborhood search is hybridized with linear programming to solve large-sized problem instances in reasonable amount of computing time in the present paper. Results of computational experiments for problem instances that are derived from a scaled-down wafer fab simulation model are provided and analyzed. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed matheuristic outperforms time-based decomposition approaches from the literature. ? 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Clearing functions; Matheuristics; Order acceptance; Planning; Semiconductor manufacturing,NP-hard; Semiconductor device manufacture; Silicon wafers; Stages; Computational experiment; Decomposition approach; Mixed integer linear program; Multi-stage manufacturing systems; Semiconductor manufacturing; Semiconductor wafer fabrication; Variable neighborhood search; Wafer fab simulation model; Integer programming,"M?nch, L.; Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Germany; 電子郵件: Lars.Moench@fernuni-hagen.de",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110131249

By digitizing the production process and connecting all levels from product design to service, the purpose of improving manufacturing efficiency, reducing production cost, enhancing product quality, and optimizing user experience can be achieved. To digitize the manufacturing process, IoT technology will have to be introduced into the manufacturing process to collect and analyze process information. However, one of the most important problems in building the industrial IoT (IIoT) environment is that different industrial network protocols are used for different equipment in factories. Therefore, the information in the manufacturing process may not be easily exchanged and obtained. To solve the above problem, a smart factory network architecture based on MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport), IoT communication protocol, is proposed in this study, to construct a heterogeneous interface communication bridge between the machine tool, embedded device Raspberry Pi, and website. Finally, the system architecture is implemented and imported into the factory, and a smart manufacturing information management system is developed. The edge computing module is set up beside a three-axis machine tool, and a human-machine interface is built for the user controlling and monitoring. Users can also monitor the system through the dynamically updating website at any time and any place. The function of real-time gesture recognition based on image technology is developed and built on the edge computing module. The gesture recognition results can be transmitted to the machine controller through MQTT, and the machine will execute the corresponding action according to different gestures to achieve human-robot collaboration. The MQTT transmission architecture developed here is validated by the given edge computing application. It can serve as the basis for the construction of the IIoT environment, assist the traditional manufacturing industry to prepare for digitization, and accelerate the practice of smart manufacturing. ?

However, a late alarm could generate defects or scraps, and thus, a prealarm is urgent to be developed. This study proposes an in-line predictive monitoring (ILPM) framework that uses process parameter monitoring (PPM) in the first phase and equipment parameter monitoring (EPM) in the second phase. PPM includes off-line training and in-line prediction, where we collect the first half of time-series data and predict the second half for in-line quality control. To maintain robustness and accuracy, the concept drift is used to update the ILPM model in real time; specifically, the EPM detects the loss of prediction by cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart or detects the change of equipment parameters by Bayesian approach for developing retraining mechanism. An empirical study of a semiconductor manufacturer indicates that the proposed ILPM framework improved both the quality control and production capacity. Note to Practitioners-Although some in-line monitoring approaches have been proposed for specific conditions, little research has been done to develop a prealarm method; in particular, this study proposes predictive monitoring by using data from multiple sensors (or status variable identifications, SVIDs) to predict one sensor in one process step of semiconductor manufacturer. The prealarm benefits the early troubleshooting and equipment capacity. This study also applies concept drift and equipment parameter monitoring (EPM) to identify the prediction model misalignment or equipment misalignment. In practice, root cause identification of the prediction error is critical and benefits the model retraining and equipment maintenance. ? 2004-2012 IEEE.",Bayesian monitoring; concept drift; failure prognosis; gated recurrent unit (GRU); in-line prediction,Bayesian networks; Control charts; Flowcharting; Forecasting; Process monitoring; Semiconductor device manufacture; Bayesian approaches; Cumulative sum control charts; Equipment parameters; Predictive monitoring; Process parameters; Production capacity; Semiconductor manufacturers; Semiconductor manufacturing; Quality control,"Lee, C.-Y.; Institute of Manufacturing Information and Systems, Taiwan; 電子郵件: cylee@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096441586

They tend to adopt sampling inspection in consideration of reducing cost and cycle time, yet that fails to achieve real-time and online total inspection because of the sampling strategy and metrology delay. Automatic Virtual Metrology (AVM) is the best solution to tackle the problem mentioned above, due to the fact that it can convert sampling inspection with metrology delay into on-line and real-time total inspection. However, with the advancement of science and technology, the processes become more and more sophisticated, and the requirement for the accuracy of virtual metrology becomes higher. The current AVM prediction algorithm is the traditional machine learning method, Back-Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN). However, even if the amount of data in this method increases, the performance improvement has its limits, and it requires a strict and time-consuming feature selection process. To improve the prediction accuracy, this work proposes the deep learning method, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for the AVM server. The accuracy of CNN improves as the amount of data grows. In other words, if there are sufficient data, the current accuracy limit of machine learning can be enhanced. Experimental results reveal that CNN can automatically extract highly informative features from the data and improves the original AVM accuracy. ? 2016 IEEE.",Automatic virtual metrology (AVM); convolutional neural networks (CNN); deep learning,Agricultural robots; Backpropagation; Convolution; Deep learning; Inspection; Learning systems; Thin film transistors; Back-propagation neural networks; Machine learning methods; Prediction accuracy; Prediction algorithms; Quality inspection; Sampling strategies; Science and Technology; Virtual metrology; Convolutional neural networks,"Cheng, F.-T.; Institute of Manufacturing Information and Systems, Taiwan; 電子郵件: chengft@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107228646

Information distortion is universally known as a fundamental reason for the variance amplification phenomenon. The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of demand information sharing in reducing bullwhip effect and improving the robustness of supply chain systems. The “automatic pipeline inventory and order-based production control system, APIOBPCS” is adopted to model supply chains with different information-sharing strategies. The stochastic factors in the supply chain system lead to poor performance in system robustness. Taguchi design is adopted to find out the optimal setting of ordering parameters in the APIOBPCS model for a robust supply chain. An extension of Taguchi design is adopted to solve the multi-response problems. The weighted signal-to-noise ratio is used as the performance index of the overall performance of the supply chain, including inventory cost, customer service level, and inventory variance amplification. The results show that full demand information transparency helps to improve the overall performance of supply chain. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis of stochastic lead times verifies the results.

This industry is one of the most energy- and emission-intensive industries in China. It is unsuspicious that energy conservation and emission reduction in this industry are crucial for China to fulfill its obligations of reducing greenhouse gas emission and mitigating global climate change. An appropriate allocation of CO2 emissions permit is the most important precondition for establishing an efficient and effective emissions trading system that had recently been launched in China's pilot regions. This paper proposes a new emissions permit allocation method based on a Nash equilibrium data envelopment analysis model. This method is more appropriate in emissions permit allocation for China's iron and steel firms in an imperfectly competitive market where the product price is endogenous. A noncooperative game is formulated and the mixed complementarity problem is utilized to identify a Nash equilibrium in the allocation of emissions permit (AEP). The most up-to-date AEP using a unique data set of China's major iron and steel enterprises in 2014 is provided in this paper. The results show that the AEP improves the desirable output generation by satisfying the reduction targets of the undesirable outputs. ? 1988-2012 IEEE.,Allocation of emissions permit (AEP); China; data envelopment analysis (DEA); iron and steel industry; Nash equilibrium,Climate change; Commerce; Data envelopment analysis; Emission control; Game theory; Greenhouse gases; Steelmaking; Competitive markets; Emissions trading system; Energy and emissions; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Global climate changes; Iron and steel enterprise; Mixed com-plementarity problems; Noncooperative game; Iron and steel industry,"Wang, K.; Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research and School of Management and Economics, China; 電子郵件: wangke03@yeah.net",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101465615

To monitor the EDM process using virtual metrology (VM), we need to obtain the electrode's voltage and current signals of a machine tool. Due to the nature of EDM, the sensors installed on the machine tool acquire the signals at a high sampling rate and generate a vast amount of data in a short time, thereby raising the big-data processing issue. Our previous work proposed an efficient approach called BEDPS to process the EDM big data in a Hadoop distributed cluster. This paper presents a novel big data processing approach to feature extraction for EDM by using container technology (i.e., Docker and Kubernetes). We re-implement some Spark algorithms of BEDPS in Python (originally in Scala) and then run the refined BEDPS in containers in a Kubernetes cluster. Testing results show that the refined BEDPS developed in this study can reduce the execution time by almost half, compared to the original Scala version (9.6577 minutes vs. 19.2735 minutes). The adoption of Python in Spark is also shown to have similar performance with Scala, although there are some cases where Python performance falls short, for example, parallel processing using Python parallel processing library. The results also show that the Kubernetes cluster is promising to be an alternative way, other than the Hadoop, for processing big data. At the same time, it can bring some advantages to the big data processing applications, such as easy deployment, robustly running, load balance, self-healing, failover, and horizontal auto-scaling for containerized applications. ? 2021 IEEE.",Big Data; Docker Container; Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM); Feature Extraction; Hadoop; Kubernetes; Python; Virtual Metrology,Big data; Containers; Data handling; Data mining; Electric discharges; Extraction; Feature extraction; High level languages; Docker container; Electrical discharge machining; Features extraction; Hadoop; Kubernetes; Parallel processing; Performance; Processing approach; Virtual metrology; Python,"Hung, M.-H.; Chinese Culture University, Taiwan; 電子郵件: hmx4@faculty.pccu.edu.tw",English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125734534

ZD of all the deliverables can be achieved by discarding the defective products via a real-time and online total inspection technology, such as Automatic Virtual Metrology (AVM). Further, the Key-variable Search Algorithm (KSA) of the Intelligent Yield Management (IYM) system developed by our research team can be utilized to find out the root causes of the defects for continuous improvement on those defective products. As such, nearly ZD of all products may be achieved. However, in a multistage manufacturing process (MMP) environment, a workpiece may randomly pass through one of the manufacturing devices with the same function in each stage. Different devices of the same type perform differently in each stage, where the performances will be accumulated through the designated manufacturing process and affect the final yield. KSA can only identify the influence of univariate variables (i.e., single devices) on the yield, yet it cannot detect the manufacturing paths that have significant influence on the yield. In order to cope with this deficiency such that the golden path with a better yield amongst all the MMP paths can be found, this research proposes the Golden Path Search Algorithm (GPSA), which can plan golden paths with high yield under the condition of the number of variables being much larger than that of samples. As a result, it makes the improvement of manufacturing yield be more comprehensive.

However, online quality estimation is challenging because high-frequency stream data derived from in situ metrology have to be processed in a timely manner to figure out the complicated interactions among material, machine, and part. To tackle such issue, this article proposes an intelligent AM metrology (IAMM) architecture to decouple and evaluate quality variations caused by material properties, machine issues, and process parameters when building an AM part. The IAMM architecture can also estimate the online layer-to-layer quality (e.g., roughness and density of an AM part) by applying the robust parameters derived from the uniform design (UD) method via the enhanced automatic virtual metrology technology in a parallel computing environment, as soon as the microfeatures of melt-pools and the macrofeatures of each layer are extracted. In addition, the associated indices and features in the IAMM architecture can also be used to evaluate the defects caused by machine issues in the given process parameters. The results of case studies validate the applicability of the IAMM architecture and show that the proposed estimation models are prospective for future closed-loop control in an AM process. Note to Practitioners - The proposed intelligent AM metrology (IAMM) architecture can be implemented modularly in a metal additive manufacturing (AM) machine that possesses the capability of estimating the coating and printing qualities of the AM process by extracting features from the optical data of the melt pools and chamber layer by layer. The estimated indices and qualities can be derived online using parallel computation to timely diagnose the machine issues and control the process of the next layer. Hence, when an AM machine is equipped with the IAMM architecture, it can efficiently manufacture a 3-D part with reduced defects in real time. ? 2020 IEEE.",Automatic virtual metrology (AVM); in situ metrology; intelligent AM metrology (IAMM) architecture; meltpool; metal additive manufacturing,3D printers; Additives; Closed loop control systems; Data streams; Defects; Frequency estimation; Lakes; Closed-loop control; Extracting features; High frequency HF; In-situ metrology; Parallel Computation; Parallel-computing environment; Process parameters; Quality estimation; Process control,"Yang, H.-C.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: hao@nkust.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099346497

In contrast to fixed staffing level designs, Shojinka achieves a notably improved productivity in changeable environments. Based on the continuous flow design guidelines presented in the literature, this study proposes a four-step procedure for evaluating and generating three stage-wise designs (namely existing, improved and future) in pursuit of Shojinka objectives. The four-step procedure commences by analyzing the layout and performance of the existing process (Step 1). An improved layout design is then established using the continuous flow guidelines (Step 2). The standard operations which achieve a balanced production with the minimal labor requirement are then determined (Step 3). Finally, the Chaku-Chaku principle is applied to determine the ideal layout which minimizes the labor requirement and maximizes the productivity (Step 4). The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a real-world automobile engine piston-rod manufacturing process for illustration purposes. It is shown that the improved and future designs improve the average worker productivity by 49.7% and 128.5%, respectively, compared to the existing design.

This paper uses convex nonparametric least squares (CNLS) and stochastic semi-nonparametric envelopment of data (StoNED) to estimate the shadow prices of PM2.5 and NOx for eleven transportation modes in seven air quality areas in Taiwan in 2013. We find that their shadow prices for two-stroke and four-stroke scooters are indifferent, and infer that it is unnecessary to develop different emissions policies for these transportation modes. However, the shadow prices for gas-fuelled vehicles which are relatively high and thus we suggest mandating advanced emissions technology or retrofits, or subsidies for electric vehicle replacements of this transportation mode.

However, only a few of these studies were related to quality of service (QoS). QoS control for WSNs is defined as the control of the number of active sensors. Effective control of the number of active sensors is important to prevent wastage in power resources and bandwidth as well as to satisfy the application demands. In a real network environment, controlling the number of active sensors is a difficult task because of the death and renewal of sensors, which cause frequent changes in the nodes. Two distributed algorithms were previously proposed for QoS control of WSNs. Two methods can be used for the effective control of sensor status: the Gur Game and ACK algorithms. This research proposed a new control algorithm called the Sensor Activity Control Strategy (SACS), which provides high-power saving of sensors. The SACS requires less time that the Gur Game and ACK algorithms to achieve the targets. ? 2020 IEEE.",Gur Game; power saving; QoS control; wireless sensor networks,Quality of service; Active sensor; Control strategies; Power resources; Random access; Real networks; Sensor status; Wireless sensor; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Wireless sensor networks,,English,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102202800

Many caching strategies and routing policies were proposed to solve the problem. This paper presents an alternative solution by designing a query-based routing table update mechanism to increase the accuracy of routing tables.

Research has shown that students’ emotional impairment with ASD severely interferes with their learning process, and academic emotions are domain-specific in nature. Therefore, the regulation of domain-specific academic emotions is an important approach to help students with ASD learn effectively. This study proposed an e-learning model that featured emotion recognition and emotion regulation to enhance mathematics e-learning for students with ASD. An emotion recognition approach based on facial recognition, an emotion regulation model, and a mathematics e-learning platform, were developed to realize the e-learning model. Two e-learning conditions: timed contest and increased difficulty of learning, were created for gathering information by observing two indexes: mathematical learning performance and negative emotional behaviors in each condition. An experiment in a mathematical e-learning context was performed to evaluate the performance of e-learning and emotion regulation effectiveness. The results of the emotion recognition classifier reached a 93.34% average recognition rate, and the participants of this experiment displayed a statistically significant decrease in targeted negative behaviors from baseline to intervention (p = .000) and significant improvements in mathematics learning performance (p = .005); however, responses to emotion regulation interventions varied among the participants.

High precision and material utilization with low production cost can be achieved through the powder metallurgy process. In order to reduce the cost of finishing processes and product scrap rate, quality management methods must be used to improve processes and increase the product yield. This study uses the Taguchi method to analyze various factors that affect parallelism in the forming stage of the powder metallurgy process and to determine the optimal parameter setting and verification. In the orthogonal array of the Taguchi method, we selected six factors with two levels as the machine setting, which would affect the product's parallelism. The current machine setting, and possible setting were determined as the first and second levels, respectively, and several experiments were designed to ascertain the configuration of the orthogonal array. After performing the designed experiments, the signal noise ratio (S/N ratio) was calculated for estimating variability of products. New samples were manufactured based on the optimal setting and compared with the original data. The experimental result revealed that the average value of parallelism data was considerably reduced for two different products and decreased approximately 55.73% and 49.44%. Values of the S/N ratio should be in the confidence interval to verify whether the whole experiment is reproducible. Thus, the product yield and production cost were simultaneously improved for this case. ? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Analysis of variance; Industry 3.5; Parallelism; Parameter optimization; Powder metallurgy; Taguchi method,Costs; Powder metallurgy; Quality management; Taguchi methods; Complex structure; Confidence interval; Designed experiments; Finishing process; Material utilization; Optimal parameter settings; Powder metallurgy process; Signal-noise ratio; Metals,"Wang, Z.-H.; Department of Industrial Engineering and System Management, No. 100, Wenhuw Rd., Taiwan; 電子郵件: zhwang@fcu.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088900756

Currently, neither ability exist! The major reason is that AM processes are different from traditional manufacturing processes in many ways and so are the sensors and the monitoring data collected from them. In traditional manufacturing, that data is mostly numeric in nature. To that numeric data, AM monitoring data add large volumes of a variety of in situ, high-speed, image data. Collecting, fusing, and analyzing all that AM data and making the necessary control decisions is not possible using traditional, rigid, hierarchical-control architectures. Therefore, researchers are proposing to use real-time, machine-learning algorithms to analyze the data and to execute the other control functions.

This study developed a novel approach for estimating the die yield from a few measurement points and a three-dimensional (3D) contour plot of die estimates for verifying the measurement pattern among the dies. The proposed IDWGA can detect the die yield pattern during the wafer exposure stage and thus optimize the exposure pattern to maximize the number of gross dies and minimize potential yield loss.

Therefore, a defect, such as chipping, occurs during processing will only be detected until the end of the process, which is too late and may cause massive defects. If Automatic Virtual Metrology (AVM) is implemented in the wafer sawing process, when chippings occur and are detected, its chipping amount can be predicted by AVM on-line and in real time. Also, AVM's individual similarity index (ISI) analysis can be applied to identify the root cause of chipping. As a result, this root cause can be fixed to avoid generating defects in the subsequent wafers. However, chipping won't happen to all wafers. Since the AVM system deals mainly with the regression problem, it cannot classify whether a wafer is chipped or not. Hence, there is a need to predict wafer-chipping occurrence before applying AVM to the wafer sawing process. To solve the above mentioned problem, the wafer sawing qualitymonitoring is divided into two stages. An Automated Classification Scheme (ACS) based on ensemble learning is developed in Stage I to pre-determine whether a wafer is chipped. If chipping is detected, then proceed to Stage II for the AVM system to predict the chipping amount and identify the root cause that results in this chipping. With the so-calledACS-plus-AVMscheme, theAVMapplication in the wafer sawing process can be realized. ? 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

The existing inspection method for wheel balance mainly relies on the off-machine measurement technique, which is time-and manpower-consuming as the worldwide requirement of the automated production system gradually increases.

A MobileNet version 2 convolutional neural network was then used as the image feature extraction model, which was combined with a single shot multibox detector model as the posterior layer to form an object detection model. The model then performed crop detection by collecting and tagging images. Empirical evidence shows that the proposed model training had a mean average precision (mAP) of 84%, which was higher than that of other models; a mAP of 89% was observed from the arm picking results. ? 2001-2012 IEEE.",deep learning; Internet of Things (IoT); multiaxial robotic arm control; object detection in smart agriculture,Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Harvesting; Image recognition; Internet of things; Multilayer neural networks; Object recognition; Robotic arms; Robotics; Image feature extractions; Internet of Things (IOT); Internet of things technologies; Machine learning models; Multiaxial; Neural network model; Recognition mechanism; Smart agricultures; Object detection,"Horng, G.-J.; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: grojium@gmail.com",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079657191

Delamination, a leading cause of defective products, can occur between die and epoxy molding compound (EMC), epoxy and substrate, lead frame and EMC, and so on. Troubleshooting is generally on a case-by-case basis and is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. We propose a three-phase data science (DS) framework for process prognosis and prediction. The first phase is for data preprocessing. The second phase uses least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and stepwise regression to identify the key variables affecting delamination. The third phase develops a backpropagation neural network (BPNN), support vector regression (SVR), partial least squares (PLS), and gradient boosting machine (GBM) to predict the ratio of the delamination area in a die. We also investigate the imbalance between a false positive rate and a false negative rate after quality classification with BPN and GBM models to improve the tradeoff between the two types of risks. We conducted an empirical study of a semiconductor manufacturer, and the results show that the proposed framework provides an effective delamination prediction supporting the troubleshooting.

If, for every v ? V(G), the paths from v to the root r in T1 and T2 are internally vertex-disjoint, they are called independent spanning trees (ISTs). ISTs can be applied in numerous fields, such as fault-tolerant broadcasting and secure message distribution. The (n,k)-star graphs Sn,k constitute a generalized version of the star network. The method of constructing ISTs in (n,k)-star graphs remains unknown. In this paper, we propose one recursive algorithm and one parallel algorithm for constructing ISTs on (n,k)-star graphs. The main ideas of the recursive algorithm are to use induction to change small trees into large trees, to use a modified breadth-first search (MBFS) traversal to create a frame for an IST, and to use a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal to connect the rest of nodes. The main ideas of the parallel algorithm are to create frames through MBFS traversals in parallel, and to use some specific rules to connect the rest of nodes in parallel. We also present validation proofs for both algorithms, and analyze the time complexities of both algorithms. The time complexity of the recursive algorithm in Sn,k is O(n × (n?n!k)! ), where (n?n!k)! is the number of nodes of Sn,k. The time complexity of the parallel algorithm can be reduced to O((n?n!k)! ) if the system has n ? 1 processors computing in parallel. Both algorithms are correct with the stated time complexity values; the parallel algorithm is more efficient than the recursive algorithm. ? 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

This study proposes Virtual Production Control Services (VPCS) for a company to identify the production risks of its CM and come up with corresponding solutions for improving demand fulfillment. By mining the updated work-in-process data from the CM, the VPCS can identify the potential production risks in a timely manner by estimating production progress based on an optimal planning model. In addition, production risks can be mitigated after applying a novel risk-control scheme such that demands can be fulfilled with reduced inventory levels. An FM case study indicates that VPCS is a promising method to improve the outsourcing efficiency of a company in the IC supply chain. ? 2020 The Chinese Institute of Engineers.",cloud service; Fabless; outsourcing manufacturing; virtual production control service,Outsourcing; Production control; Risk perception; Supply chains; Cloud Manufacturing; Contract manufacturers; Corresponding solutions; Demand fulfillments; Optimal planning models; Potential production; Production process; Virtual production; Manufacture,"Yang, H.-C.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: hao@nkust.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091123281

Therefore, this research proposed a novel facial thermal image feature extraction method, which is used facial landmarks to detect and cut 12 blocks to establish a new feature matrix based on color mean values and standard deviation values. It can establish clear features on facial thermal images. The core part of the proposed healthcare system is the use of a deep learning framework, which is based on CAFFE under the DIGITS platform.

Alternatively, adopting a mobile beacon to travel along a specific trajectory and to broadcast its locations at specific points is more efficient. Therefore, path planning of the mobile beacon originally focused on finding shortest path length and minimum broadcast points, such as Scan and Hilbert, to decrease power consumption. More recently, path planning increasingly attempted to achieve higher accuracy, such as Double-scan and Z-scan. However, optimal trade-off between power efficiency and localization accuracy is yet to be achieved.

A data science framework including variable selection (e.g., multivariate adaptive regression splines, stepwise logistic regression and random forest), prediction models (e.g., support vector machine, boosting logistic regression and backpropagation neural network (BPN)) and decision analysis (e.g., Bayesian method) is proposed to identify the important variables and support the extubation decision. An empirical study of a leading hospital in Taiwan in 2015–2016 is conducted to validate the proposed framework. The results show that APACHE II and white blood cells (WBC) are the two most critical variables, and then the priority sequence is eye opening, heart rate, glucose, sodium and hematocrit. BPN with selected variables shows better prediction performance (sensitivity: 0.830; specificity: 0.890; accuracy 0.860) than that with APACHE II or RSBI. The value of information is further investigated and shows that the expected value of experimentation (EVE), 0.652 days (patient staying in the ICU), is saved when comparing with current clinical experience. Furthermore, the maximal value of information occurs in a failure rate around 7.1% and it reveals the “best applicable condition” of the proposed prediction model.

The proposed scheme is aimed at providing an effective model to a deep-learning-based object detection module for accurately identifying defects among dense beans. The proposed GALDAM can be used to greatly reduce labor costs, since the data labeling is the most labor-intensive work in this sort of solutions. Our proposed scheme brings two main impacts to intelligent agriculture. First, our proposed scheme is can be easily adopted by industries as human effort in labeling coffee beans are minimized. The users can easily customize their own defective bean model without spending a great amount of time on labeling small and dense objects. Second, our scheme can inspect all classes of defective beans categorized by the SCAA (Specialty Coffee Association of America) at the same time and can be easily extended if more classes of defective beans are added. These two advantages increase the degree of automation in the coffee industry. The prototype of the proposed scheme was developed for studying integrated tests.

In this work, we propose a novel labor-efficient deep learning-based model generation scheme, aiming at providing an effective model with less human labeling effort. The key idea is to iteratively generate new training images containing defective beans in various locations by using a generative-adversarial network framework, and these images incur low successful detection rate so that they are useful for improving model quality. Our proposed scheme brings two main impacts to the intelligent agriculture. First, our proposed scheme is the first work to reduce human labeling effort among solutions of vision-based defective bean removal. Second, our scheme can inspect all classes of defective beans categorized by the SCAA (Specialty Coffee Association of America) at the same time. The above two advantages increase the degree of automation to the coffee industry. We implement the prototype of the proposed scheme for conducting integrated tests.

This paper proposes a novel equipment health index (EHI) framework and a Hotelling T-squared index (HTI) to monitor equipment and support preventive maintenance in real time in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. The EHI framework consists of data preprocessing, statistical process control, analytic hierarchy process, and a comprehensive single index representing the health condition of equipment. It considers different types of the univariate control charts for each status variable identification (SVID), and aggregates the scores corresponding to the control charts throughout the hierarchical structure. The HTI considers the correlation among the selected SVIDs and builds a multivariate index by using Hotelling T-squared statistic. An empirical study of Taiwan's leading semiconductor assembly manufacturer finds that both the EHI and the HTI supported monitoring thousands of pieces of equipment in real time.

The most critical issue of using DDF remains that how to appropriately project the inefficient decision-making unit onto the production frontier along with a justified direction. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on the techniques for selecting directional vector of the directional distance function. It begins with a brief introduction of the existing methods around the inclusion of the exogenous direction techniques and the endogenous direction techniques. The former commonly includes arbitrary direction and conditional direction techniques, while the latter involves the techniques for seeking theoretically optimized directions (i.e., direction towards the closest benchmark or indicating the largest efficiency improvement potential) and market-oriented directions (i.e., directions towards cost minimization, profit maximization, or marginal profit maximization benchmarks). The main advantages and disadvantages of these techniques are summarized, and the limitations inherent in the exogenous direction-selecting techniques are discussed.

Today, however, this traditional business shutdown criterion (BSC) as defined by microeconomic theory may no longer apply to some types of industry; one example is the high-tech industry. This study proposes a BSC scheme that uses an iterative procedure embedded with three phases: level analysis, margin analysis, and budget and action, to solve the shutdown decision problem via proactive marginal productivity. We validate the proposed scheme with a case study of light-emitting diode manufacturers in Taiwan, the majority of which continued to operate and expand capacity despite experiencing a profit drop due to global competition and higher sunk cost of capital investment.

In this way, not only tool availability and manufacturing quality are improved, but the additional cost of excessive maintenance in preventive maintenance strategy can also be reduced. Among the predictive maintenance technologies proposed by many scholars, exponential model was commonly applied to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of TD. However, due to the algorithm limitations, when TD is about to die, whether the TD's aging feature suddenly rises or becomes smooth, the exponential model may not be able to keep up with the real-time prediction or even falsely predicts long RUL. To solve the problem of inaccurate RUL prediction, the authors propose the time series prediction (TSP) algorithm. TSP applies the time series analysis model built by information criterion to adapt to the complicated future trend of solving TD fault prediction.

However, there is no comprehensive method for the total quality inspection of carbon fiber products so far due to its feature of continuous production and destructive examination of quality inspection. Through years of development, the Automatic Virtual Metrology (AVM) technology has been applied to various industries to turn the offline sampling inspection with metrology delay into online and real-time total inspection. With AVM, every workpiece of the carbon fiber products can be examined to ensure total quality inspection. The biggest issue of continuous production is that it can neither accurately define each unit nor label on the products. To solve this problem, a production data traceback (PDT) mechanism is proposed in this letter. The PDT mechanism can provide a virtual label to each unit for referring back to the process parameters of the production.

However, explosive growth in social media had produced enormous quantities of texts, images, and videos, which is sometimes referred to as a digital footprint. This provides an alternative channel for enterprises seeking to gain an objective understanding of their target consumers. Facilitating the analysis of data used in the formulation of a marketing strategy based on digital footprints from online social media is crucial for enterprises seeking to enhance their competitive advantage in today's markets. This study develops an approach for predicting consumer decision-making styles by analyzing digital footprints on Facebook to assist enterprises in rapidly and correctly mastering the consumption profile of consumers, thereby reducing marketing costs and promoting customer satisfaction. This objective can be achieved by performing the following tasks: (i) designing a process for predicting consumer decision-making styles based on the analysis of digital footprints on Facebook, (ii) developing techniques related to consumer decision-making style prediction, and (iii) implementing and evaluating a consumer decision-making style prediction mechanism. In the practical experiment, we obtained questionnaires and various digital footprint contents (including ""Likes,"" ""Status,"" and ""Photo/Video"") from 3304 participants in 2018, 2644 of which were randomly selected as a training dataset, with the remaining 660 participants forming a testing dataset. The experimental results indicated that the accuracy increased to 75.88% and proved that the approach proposed in this study can effectively predict consumers' decision-making styles. ? 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Consumer decision-making style; digital footprint; Facebook,Commerce; Competition; Computer graphics; Customer satisfaction; Forecasting; Social networking (online); Statistical tests; Surveys; Competitive advantage; Consumer decision-making styles; digital footprint; Facebook; Marketing strategy; Online social medias; Prediction mechanisms; Questionnaire surveys; Decision making,"Chen, Y.-J.; Department of Accounting and Information Systems, Taiwan; 電子郵件: yjchen@nkust.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056839422

One of key components in the motors are bearings, and it is critical to measure the key features of bearings to support maintenance decision. This paper proposes a data science approach with embedded statistical data mining and a machine learning algorithm to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of the bearings in a motor. The vibration signals of the bearings are collected from the experimental platform, and fault detection devices are developed to extract the important features of bearings in time domain and frequency domain. Regression-based models are developed to predict the RUL, and weighted least squares regression (WLS) and feasible generalized least squares regression (FGLS) are used to address the heteroscedasticity problem in the vibration dataset. Support vector regression (SVR) is also applied for prediction benchmarking. Case studies show that the proposed data science approach handled large datasets with ease and predicted the RUL of the bearings with accuracy. The features extracted from time domain are more significant than those extracted from frequency domain, and they benefit engineering knowledge. According to the RUL results, the PdM policy is developed for component replacement at the right moment to avoid the catastrophic equipment failure. ? 2019 by the authors.",Data mining; Electric motor; Feasible generalized least squares regression; Predictive maintenance; Remaining useful life,Data Science; Domestic appliances; Electric motors; Fault detection; Forecasting; Frequency domain analysis; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Repair; Engineering knowledge; Experimental platform; Generalized least squares regressions; Predictive maintenance; Regression-based model; Remaining useful lives; Support vector regression (SVR); Weighted least squares; Data mining,"Liu, M.-K.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Taiwan; 電子郵件: mkliu@mail.ntust.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,"All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062416705

Marginal abatement costs (MAC), also termed shadow prices of air pollution emissions, provide valuable guidelines to support environmental regulatory policies for CO2, SO2 and NOx, the key contributors to climate change, smog, and acid rain. This study estimates the marginal abatement cost of undesirable outputs with respect to the Nash equilibrium on the stochastic semi-nonparametric envelopment of data (StoNED) in an imperfectly competitive market. Considering an endogenous price function of electricity, the mixed complementarity problem (MiCP) is formulated to identify the Nash equilibrium in a production possibility set. The proposed model addresses the four issues of MAC estimation in the existing literature. Applying the proposed method to an empirical study of 33 coal-fired power plants operating in China in 2013 shows that StoNED provides a robust frontier that is not sensitive to the outlier and the proposed interval of MAC estimation validates the shadow prices corresponding to the Nash equilibrium in an imperfectly competitive market. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Data envelopment analysis; Emissions trading; Marginal abatement costs; Nash equilibrium; Stochastic semi-nonparametric frontier,Acid rain; Climate change; Coal; Commerce; Computation theory; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Data envelopment analysis; Emission control; Fossil fuel power plants; Game theory; Stochastic systems; Air pollutant emission; Coal-fired power plant; Emissions Trading; Marginal abatement costs; Mixed com-plementarity problems; Nash equilibria; Nonparametric frontier; Production possibility set; Air pollution,"Lee, C.-Y.; Institute of Manufacturing Information and Systems, Taiwan; 電子郵件: cylee@mail.ncku.edu.tw",English,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053671254

Many techniques including unmanned aerial vehicle, robot, and auto-car, are applied to assist SAR nowadays.

The ability to analyze this volume and variety of data in real-time is necessary for effective closed-loop control and decision-making. Existing control architectures are unable to handle this level of data volume and speed. This paper investigates the functional and computational requirements for real-time closed-loop AM process control. The paper uses those requirements to propose a function architecture for AM process monitoring and control.
